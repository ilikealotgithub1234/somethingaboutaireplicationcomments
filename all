commentpurifier.html:34 [Riot im not doubting you can do itt!!!]
commentpurifier.html:34 [This level revolutionized Geometry Dash. It was a high-quality level by many amazing creators, and it was built to be the hardest thing ever beaten in the history of GD. With 4 million views on YouTube and over 6 million downloads on GD, it was mind-blowing to see. This made the community bigger and stronger, by showing that what was once thought to be impossible, can be done. This blew up Riot as well. Riot had been doing amazing things, but this was by far the biggest. He got huge fame and respect among the community, and he deserved it. This inspired many more hard levels to be made (e.g. Bloodlust, Aftermath, Sonic Wave Buffdate, etc). This was an amazing achievement, not just on GD, but in gaming in general. Although this level has fallen off the top 10 on the hardest demons list, its legacy still lives.  So thanks to Weoweoteo, Vermillion, Michigun, Evasium, Crack, ASonicMen, Etzer, Havok, Giron David, Gboy and Riot. Also, best of luck to anyone who has beating this, is attempting this, or is planning to beat this in the future.  And once more, thanks Bloodbath, for making GD what it is today <3]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Hey guys is the most dislike level is the hardest one hardest than the bloodbath]
commentpurifier.html:34 [3:20 epic rotate XD]
commentpurifier.html:34 [This is truly amazing that you beat this. I think it's amazing that you could accomplish this. I've heard that it took you over 8,000 attempts to complete Clubstep. (One of) the best player in Geometry Dash took 8,000 attempts to beat the simplest demon level. I don't find that embarrassing, I find that motivational to players that feel like they can't beat even the simplest demons. Even me. I have yet to be Clubstep and I'm currently going for Deadlocked (I know Deadlocked is way harder and should do Clubstep first but I'm better at Deadlocked.) And when I feel sad I'm just like: 'Hey, the best friggin' player in the game was like me once. And it took him over 8,000 attempts to do it. And look where that got him!' So I just thought about how you're one of the best Geometry Dash players out there and inspire so many people to become better at this game. PS, what are your thoughts on Bloodlust? You think that level is interesting?]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Danang Wibisono first. Stop using all caps. It's very annoying and makes your comment hard to read. Second. Riot quit because of pain in his hand, not because of sunix. Third. Why say "GMD?" It makes no sense. It's Geometry Dash, not GeoMetry Dash. Sorry for ranting, this comment just annoyed me.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [I think he quit because of finger pain, not Sunix. And he may have returned because of Buffbath.    And please don't type in all caps. ;v]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Dank Memes  Yeah but yesterday when i played geometry dash, i saw the sign that Riot is back after the hacking was over. He changed his icons and saw his status in his profile that he would make silent akbar and maybe he will verify it]

And I had like only 5k stars when I did this. 13,678 attempts... it's over. (My reaction sucked by the way... It sounded something like this,"GG!" *falls on floor*.)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [in the end though...imagine being a player and read "GG <3 RIOT" And then die by the spike next to it. that would be to crazy]

commentpurifier.html:34 [I think Bloodbath will forever be the hardest level known to man. (Unless RioT decides to go insane and make a harder level, then verifies it) EDIT: I did not know many big levels when I made this comment. Also, I think Orochi will probably be the hardest for a while. (If it is verified)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Epic awesome and riot is with us]
commentpurifier.html:34 [wait he touched the spikes and did not die right here 3:10 are you hacking?]

commentpurifier.html:34 [I really don't understand why they say Athanatos and Sakupen Hell is harder... When I look at both levels, I just see Athanatos very easy as well as Sakupen Hell. And I still see Bloodbath way harder. Just because someone says something us harder than Bloodbath doesn't mean it is harder than Bloodbath. For example, TrusTa said that Sakupen Hell was harder than Bloodbath just to get attention and become more famous and he also wanted to feel like he has done something way better as well as Aurorus with Athanatos. Bloodbath is harder than Athanatos and Sakupen Hell]
commentpurifier.html:34 [The 4th Hardest demon... After a year, Bloodbath was considered the impossible, now it's not... Artificial Ascent in 3rd place, Sonic wave in 2nd and Yatagarasu in 1st... But there will be no demon level with a greater and darker story than Bloodbath. Not even Bloodlust.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [swag]
commentpurifier.html:34 [GG! I can't pass this level in practise (35 minutes and 21% T_T). I ask you for something: are you one of creators of GD? I think you are, but I don't know. YOU ARE THE BEST GD PLAYER EVER!]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Cola Gaming Your explanation proves and means nothing retarded atheist. There's nothing your braindead ass can do to change my belief. I will not listen to an atheist explaining the same, ignorant stupid shit every other clueless atheist would say. But I'll win in the end, cause you'll burn in hell. Btw, "free will" covers up half your dumb explanation.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Shut your stupid ass up. You make absolutely no sense. Alright let's take a look outside, crime, pollution, corruption everywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if all of Earth's resources are gone in a few decades. A President is restricting entire countries from entering his domain, and I bet half the people that are in those restricted countries are highly praying to their "savior" just be ignored as the problems within "God's Gift" (Earth) continues. Where was God when Hitler rose to power and killed off millions of his devoted followers? He was nowhere. Now let's look at the universe, and the vastness of space what makes Earth so significant? There are plenty of planets capable of sustaining life(Kepler-186f is just 1 example), so did he make clones of himself for every other planet? seems unlikely. And bruh, the bible. One of the most contradictory books every written and you're gonna use that to justify the existence of god? Alright, so who wrote the bible? "Uhhhhh, Jesus' disciples" And how do you know that? "Uhhhhh, because it said it in the bible". So you're saying that if I wrote a book, and in that book I say that I'm a dragon are you gonna believe me? No. It doesn't make sense. "how could they possibly make all of our history up in that book" Said a not so wise man. Half of the explanations they have in the book have been proven incorrect. Let's look at the bible's explanation for rainbows, "The Biblical meaning of the colors of the rainbow are that red signifies sin, orange means evil, yellow stands for eternal life and purple signifies loyalty. In addition, in the Biblical context, the colors of the rainbow taken as a whole signify God's covenant with man to never again destroy the world with a flood." Yeahhhhh, nice try but no, you're all wrong. This is the actual explanation for rainbows, "We see rainbows because of the geometry of raindrops. When the sun shines from behind us into the rain, incident rays of light enter the drop and are refracted inwards. They are reflected from the back surface of the raindrop, and refracted again as they exit the raindrop and return to our eyes. Refraction is responsible for splitting the sunlight into its component colors." Your argument is invalid, God doesn't exist.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Tiny Duck Games It would honestly be impossible for an atheist to change my belief. I'm not saying you should change what you believe, that's your damn choice. Just the comparison between Christians, atheists, and Satanic ppl I've met, atheists are easily the most asshole, dumbest ppl I've met. What exactly do you think made us? Apes some ppl say? Well what do you think created the apes then? I may respect your belief, but I do not respect how you treat mine. Honestly, the only possible explanation to everything in existence is a god. God's also can't be "created" either, and it's obvious that you know hardly all that much about the bible, and I'm retarded to believe what ancient ppl have seen and wrote in an ancient book? It seems more retarded to not believe it tbh. All around the world is believing there's a god to this current day. ]
commentpurifier.html:34 [The Black Soul Are you retarded, Why do you belive something is true from a Fucking 2000 year book. also, if god made everything, what made god. Also a flaw in the bible, if god created the sun on the 4th day how had 4 days passed?]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Mlg7803 GD You have no physical fucking proof, so you cant say anything. We can only go by the videos posted online. Also, how would krazy verify it if it was harder than yata? He is a 60hz player.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Skellter that is because of boj and bloodlust but it is harder than yata.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Mlg7803 GD WHO everybody ? Stupid kids like you. The community thinks that every upcoming extreme demon is nr1 like Artificial Ideolgy and it endid up on #15. So stfu. Pro players say  even Krazy say that Black Blizzard will end up top 5 on #3 or #4.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Skellter everybody says it is, dont get triggered lol]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Vale Pirez but yatagarasu was replaced by Black Blizzard]
commentpurifier.html:34 [it has been replaced by yatagarasu]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Mlg7803 GD I'm doing bloodbath right now, and I can say with experience that Sakupen Hell is harder. The waves are unlike anything seen in BB. BB is long, which means each part is easier. If all you've done are practice runs, then I can't take that as evidence when I've practiced both demons.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [also this proof is unstable but:  bloodbath first practice run: 1400+ attempts sakupen hell first practice run: ~400 attempts]
commentpurifier.html:34 [GD Yelooh no it isnt, even though the forums say so, how can a medium level beat an xl demon? and now you might say "wave timings". the wave parts take 30 seconds or maybe even less of the level. the rest is super ez.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Mlg7803 GD Sakupen Hell is harder than Bloodbath.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [it was not beaten by athanatos, neither by sakupen hell. number 4 hardest demon]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Jos now yatagarasu üòâ]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Brian Wang yeah but it won't get rated because it's not legit]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Don't worry BB is higher above Athanatos now]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Anayeli Hernandez Sonic wave is harder and longer than sakupen hell.....]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Anayeli Hernandez what about the level from Hell SONIC WAVE]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Tunku_Umar your right they are not ready for pure Hell]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Sakupen Hell should be #1 for sure]
commentpurifier.html:34 [People have skill for bloodbath now but not yet for hell]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Ik Sakupen hell is hard but the reason everyone says it's harder than bloodbath is because by this time it's new and many have mastered bloodbath if both of them were released at the same time people will say bloodbath harder]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Tunku_Umar nope, its in the top ten demons rn, sakupen hell is WAY harder than you think]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Sakupen hell is an extreme demon but it's never harder than he 50th hardest demon as it's only a medium]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Swift Tech I always preffered Sonic Wave before Bloodbath]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Jos sonic wave now :(]
commentpurifier.html:34 [yeah true but if every demon in 1.9 or earlier had 2.0 theyd all probably be a little buffed, and that means BB]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Jos but 2.0 demons have way more harder features to add to levels this will the hardest 1.9 demon]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Jos Yeah you might've btw Athanatos is harder than both]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Why?! Y athanatos. Y it couldn't be some high quality level ;-;]
commentpurifier.html:34 [i think i've started a flamewar, oops]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Someone finally gets it! Bloodbath is by far, longer and tigther than both]
commentpurifier.html:34 [The only reason hell and athanatos are "harder" or higher up on the demon list is because as of right now there aren't as many completions and they're new, also because they're a lot more cancerous (more spam)]

Now, if you truly believed that, you wouldn't have attacked me to begin with. You sir, are a hypocrite. Moving on, when I said look in a mirror, I was not referring to the physical face he would see.

I am a mobile player and i play on an iPad and whenever a reply is added in a comment i replied in it automatically sends me a nitification that someone else replied and it makes a noise and notification noises fade the music and lag the level up and then it gets bugged so then i fail.

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash xClockinx if you're trying to "what if", you, at least, need to make it in some sense possible. Well, you can't make a level a different rating without RobTop. "The entire community" can't do crap to make Bloodbath easy. So you sir, can shut up. Retard means a mentally ill person, and I'm not a "retard". Go back home and sleep, you prick.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+R!DE Yes you can retard]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+_Digital¬†shut up, you prick. "What if" still needs to follow some sort of reality. You can't have a "what if" that is easily defied by our rules of whatever. In this case, the rules of Geometry Dash. You should learn how to read, idiot.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+R!DE yah, learn how to read, it clearly said "what if"]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Do you even play Geometry Dash? You can't make a level another difficulty. Only RobTop can rate levels, and when it's rated, we can't rate it anymore.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [OK, guys. At first, before I maybe say something wrong, I just want you, Riot to know that even if I think of this, you are still my idole and the best GD player in the world. Ok. Starting from, like, 2:00, your ship trail starts to stop for a verry little time. You have to look carefully. That is known as hack. The hack in 1.9 usually affects the trail during playing. So, I don't know if you hacked, because you are gr8 at GD, or maybe it was a bug of 1.9. If you hacked just reply this comment, and tell me. You don't have to be shy. I hacked in my life too]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Here's a funny story. So, I'm fairly new at GD, not a pro yet (I finally beat Hexagon Force and Clutterfunk yesterday). I have yet to actually complete a Demon Level. Or even reach halfway through one, and I'm not afraid to admit it. One day, a couple months ago (before I beat Electroman even), I decided to go around and attempt a bunch of Demon levels, to see what kind of damage I could do to them. Bloodbath was one of the first ones I clicked on. After dying at 1% about 50 times, I said to myself, "I can do this. This beginning part is difficult, but I doubt its too hard after it. The furthest I got was 4% before I got frustrated and moved on. Little did I know, this is considered one of the most difficult levels in all of Geometry Dash, and that it is MUCH MORE difficult past the beginning lol. Now, I still want to beat a Demon level (If you have any suggestions of easier Demon levels that I should try, feel free to comment them ;) pls), but I'm not going to try the harder Demons until I'm ready, and I'm not going to let myself stress over them too much, until I beat Electrodynamix (which I currently have 71% on). Once I beat THAT, then I'll focus on beating Demons.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [robtop powah!! xD]
commentpurifier.html:34 [some guy made a video saying that you hacked but i don't think so you are just really good at the game. he is broadly just can't beat the level. keep up the good work.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [There Are 6 Levels Of MLGDP (Major League Geometry Dash Player) 1: Beginner 2: Intermediate 3: Pro 4: Expert. 5: Superstar. 6: Master (Only For People Who Are Good As Riot.)

commentpurifier.html:34 [X by triaxis]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad Speed Racer is a fairly easy fun level]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Ligtning Road]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad the most easy demon i have beaten is called The Nightmare. Probably the easiest demon out there.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Impulse was the first demon I've beaten. It's a pretty easy demon.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [ID: 915886  It even has a hidden path at the end with the gravity spike. The only hard part (for me, atleast) is timing the flappy UFO.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad The Lightning Road]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad its so cool how the gd community has helped u ive read the comments well some not all way too much and yea good luck on beating more demons :)))]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+WarlockDustin' It took me about the same amount of time. I had put like 80 attempts into it before I'd ever legit tried to beat a demon, so when I beat it it was through 53 practice attempts (in which I completed the level 3 times) and then 44 normal mode attempts, for a grand total of 97 :)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+WarlockDustin' Haha no problem :D and in less attempts. You got skills man :D]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Konsta Kovala That sucks. Do you have bad internet or something?]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Konsta Kovala Reanimation? Its way cool. It has an epic boss fight in it.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad now I need to find a demon .]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad no , it still demon for me]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Konsta Kovala Oh practice mode became my best friend once I started pursuing demons. Before, I thought practice mode was a waste of time. Boy did I not know how wrong I was until I went after some demons. I'll be sure to give it extra practice then :) Also, if anyone is interested, I actually have a level I'm in the process of verifying that is going to be demon. Its going to be a medium to hard demon. Its going to be called Deep Freeze. I'll probably post about it when I finally do verify it. (Its turning out to be a nightmare to verify, because not only is it difficult, but its over 4 minutes long). If anyone is interested I'd love to have it played when I get it done :)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad you have to practice it to memorise the parts that you know what to do and it has like 2-3 pretty fast skill parts. Good luck!!]
commentpurifier.html:34 [I've got 5 now :) I beat yStep most recently. I played one earlier today, and I reached 40% pretty quickly (like 12 attempts lol). Its called Reanimation. Anyone know how hard that one is?]
commentpurifier.html:34 [toe 2 is pretty easy i beated it in five months of training and i were a noob, but now im completing hard wave challenges (Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad Hahaha, I had a VERY similar experience when I first joined GD.  I had only beaten up to back on track I think and I ran into Supersonic on the features page.  I thought it was possible for a brief moment but then gave up at like 3%.  Later I found the youtube GD community and realized it was one of the extreme demons lol. (and back then it had just came out and it was considered a lot harder, almost no one had beaten it legit yet)]

commentpurifier.html:34 [But some easy demons I've beaten are  Lightning road The nightmare Crazy Insomnia X DarnocDynamix Atlas Demon mixed And Xstep v2]
commentpurifier.html:34 [100% deadlocked lol]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad I needed a fifth Demon and since Demon Mixed only took you 177 attempts, I tried it...it took me 91 and only about 10-15 minutes...thanks for unintentionally leading me to a ridiculously easy Demon!]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad¬† Demon step is a pretty good practice for gravity ball. ¬†I was able to beat it in 40 minutes a few days ago. ¬†It was my 5th demon.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Joey D 23% Deadlocked]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Doing better than me xD.  I only have 18% on deadlocked.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [i beat all default levels except for deadlocked._. (deadlocked im like 46%)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad After that, try xStep v2, ClutterStep and DarnocDynamix.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Mateus Souza Impulse. Got it :) I'll let you know how I do :)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad Now try Impulse.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [I've beaten 4 now :D The Nightmare: 335 attempts The Lightning Road: 337 attempts Crescendo: 1006 attempts Demon Mixed: 177 attempts :)Ôªø]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Some of the easier demons would be The Nightmare (it was my first demon) Lightning Road, Super Cycles is semi hard, and Demon Step.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [I got a few suggestions: The Lightning Road by Timeless ( if you can't find it go to map packs and go to Demon pack 3), The nightmare by GW Jax, Infinite circles by Startor , and Seeker of Demon by seeker they are the easiest demons I know of, they may take a little over 1000 attempts but their demons what do you expect?]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash Sirius Yes, it is.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [CLUBSTEP]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Try The lighting road]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad The Lightning Road, Demon Mixed and The Nightmare are the easiest DEMONs of Geometry Dash. Also, xStep v2, Impulse and Crescendo are kinda easy.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [the lightning road is really easy]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Try the Lightning road cause it was the 1st demon I completed]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Evil Toad In my time playing Geometry Dash, I've beaten 16 demon levels, the hardest of which is either Clubstep or -Sirius- by FunnyGame. Some of them are pretty easy, though, like The Lightning Road by Timeless, and GREEN DEMON by Nano4618. I have a playlist on YouTube of all the Demon levels I've played. Check it out if you want some more suggestions.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Horror and Halloween 101 I'm pretty sure the joke was started by Cyrillic when he released an impossible level that looks like back on track but it has a lot of invisible objects everywhere making it impossible, or I could be completely wrong, who knows?]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Horror and Halloween 101 it's cuz bot is so much easier than stereo madness that people saying it was ultra hard as jokes.

commentpurifier.html:34 [It's a joke. lol]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+llRiotll I'm so proud of you beating BB but CC witch of a madder of course is kind of the EASIER demon version of BB because they are both INSANE demons but I don't get why CC was made first because its kind of like putting an easier version of a not even created level. Some people don't even get this mix up. And a matter of fact... I don't. So is there something I'm not getting or all the people in GD are just mistaken because BB was actually supposed to be a MUCH HARDER demon then CC? I really don't get it at all... Because also Gb0y had the 2nd hardest part in BB or maybe 1st but he was the one who created CC? I'm not getting this at ALL. Its like FNAF all over again (of course I had to do that). But I just HAPPENDLY want to know if BB was a harder version of CC or CC was supposed to be an easier version of BB? Either comment it or don't choose either but then that's when I get into my DUMB zone. Cause then now I'm thinking that CC and BB are 2 TODALY different things. I just don't get it cause CC and BB are most rather A LOT alike! Its like I don't know I cant handle it its just to MUCH! I'm not getting this as a side chain of Riot beating CC then beating ICDX and had an idea to smoosh them together into one of the known HARDEST demons in GD. You asked all of the good creators exept for Zenthic and Vip and wanted them to make parts of BB and then you wanted to get all of those parts and smoosh them together in level editor and randomly be the only one with the shortest part of BB. Witch is of course the beginning witch then ends straight away after you do that wave part with actually spikes that CROSS there normal way they spawn of putting them up one and that's it. I'm thinking you wanted to have the hardest part. Although your part ends up as the 3rd hardest part in BB or maybe even that ship part on ethisium was maybe even HARDER. Well who cares I'm just really confused of this. Its actually quite similar to FNAF so the FNAF 1 that pizzeria ends up as actually the second pizzeria and then the FNAF 2 restaurant ended up as the first restaurant. Just like either CC accidently ended up as coming first. (Glad you read all this skrub I'm proud of u). Just please tell me what's happening. I mean its weird like BB v2 is insane and a HELL lot easier. just like FNAF 3 is easier then actually all the games. IM SO CONFUSED. Please reveal the true story of why this happened. I know everyone who is about to comment is gonna be like "Well you didn't know that CC was actually made before BB just Riot had a LOT longer time!" WELL NO! CC was right verified before BB was completed. I know CC was first not because it was verified first but because it was made first. I am expecting there to be coins to CC and then Riots Randomly GoNnA bEaT iCdX v2 and then he's just DUMB enough to think he can make a BB v2. Your probably gonna get REALLY intimidated into doing it because you're actually just gonna call it BB v2 but then only add coins to it. No change just coins. If I'm not getting this straight then I must be taking this thing WAY to far! I'm sorry if this was a waste of time just because the situation isn't really that big of a deal but it is to ME! Now I know SOMEDAY you will be just eager to make a BB v2 and do exactly what I said "Your not gonna make any changes just add coins". So as always why is this so confusing and why is this such a problem to GD players saying "OMG CC is easier than BB but BB isn't even out!". I'm like that to. I'm VERY eager to know what happened because I personally know that CC is an easier version of BB. Same stuff everywhere. Literally I'm confused.

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid It quite literally says "no thank you". Meaning that I did NOT thank you. Were there a comma, "no, thank you" then I would have been thanking you. But what I said means that I am not thanking you.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron now u changing it again bro lol]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid No, you said both meanings applied. I said that I only meant for the second meaning, BUT if you feel like the noun of a troll (first definition) applies to you, then go ahead and accept that title.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron u deny it first now u say yes to both meanings. Lol u trying to hide ur failure]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash ioprocessing bro just calm down]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+ExPwn wow homophobe. I hope u die irl]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid You're frickin' retarded. If a word has multiple definitions then it only takes on ONE meaning when used. But, I suppose both can apply to you if you want.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [Guess I can cross 'Getting a troll to admit they were trolling' off my bucket list.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid¬†ur fucking gay i hope u die]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron yeah so u called me both things cuz it has 2 meanings]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid No. -_-  The SECOND definition says "offensive OR PROVOCATIVE". That has nothing to do with an ugly dwarf.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron so u call me  a ugly dwarf dude screw u I thot u were cool]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid OR provocative. ;)]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron dude my post wasn't offensive it was a simple question]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid  Troll Definition:  Troll (1):  a mythical, cave-dwelling being depicted in folklore as either a giant or a dwarf, typically having a very ugly appearance.  Troll (2):  make a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them.   So yes, you are technically correct, but I was referring to the other definition.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron dude trolls are a mythical creature That live under a bridgr]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid That's what trolling is. Pranking or joking to the extent where it ticks people off.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid Nope, I just know cause I saw a video on it while watching videos of people exposing hackers.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid I know it doesn't to you, read the first sentence I said again.  If you are to claim that the only reason he knows that hacks don't work anymore is because he tried it, then the same logic can be applied to you. How do you even know that you can hack Geometry Dash? Because you've done it?]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+mosertron lol that makes no sense]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Sir Osaid Dude, you are freakin' retarded. I assume the only reason you know that hacking even exists is from experience? Moron...]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF I argee with most of your points, but saying the *if* he hacked doesn't matter is very wrong.So many people have worked together to build this extra-long level, many people have been streaming Riot trying to verify this in MONTHS, and if he hacked, then everyone would lose faith in Riot, the very best player in GD, in my opinion. But yes, saying he hacked without proof is pretty damm stupid :3]

commentpurifier.html:34 [Um you don't understand, I meant people should not waste their times commenting about the person hacking and getting mad at them, do I sound mad to you? And I am not even commenting about riot being a hacker...]
commentpurifier.html:34 [I understand that, but you said that there is no reason to comment it and you are right, so you shouldn't comment about it.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+TGI {Zombies/COD} So what? There is that much to say about these people.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [You literally just typed three long comments about people getting mad.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF And this is just a game, everybody is taking it way too seriously. Aren't you suppose to have fun in this game not arguing who hacks and who doesn't? Let hackers be, they purchased this game so they can do as they want with it, it's just like hackers in any other game, you cannot get rid of hackers so if you see a Geometry Dash video that is hacked just ignore it, yous are all wasting your time commenting about it because the hacker really wouldn't care but none of yous know how to ignore...]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF Also I don't think Riot did hack this and here is my reason: If you want to hack a Geometry dash level and put it on a stream he would have to record the speed hacked version of it (the slow motion gameplay) then he would have to speed it up and then he would have to record every part in the video to make it look like it is actually real and then he would stream the recording of the hacked gameplay that is sped up, and the orbs wouldn't move in parts of the level anyways if it really was hacked because the level would loose it's sync. So instead of going through all this video editing stuff he could just beat it legit like he did, by the time he is done patching all the hacked content in the hacked gameplay he would of finished this legit by now. I would rather beat this legit then do that, and it isn't hard to spot if someone is hacking. I mean I am not going to lie I find his trail a bit questionable but I really don't care anyways just leave Riot alone all he is doing is uploading videos, if you do not like it then you can go away and stop bothering people, thanks.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [The Bloodbath Challenge  Every 10 attempts you die on bloodbath (Non-Practice), you pinch yourself, each in a different spot. When you get to 100 attempts and haven't passed 30%, you add another pinch every 10 attempts you die. So, 100-199 attempts would be 2 pinches, 200-299, 4 pinches and so on. Start at your hands and gradually continue upwards, pinch hard but not too hard, or there will be a Bloodbath.  Good luck, and don't hurt yourself too much, remember that this is just a game and you can stop the challenge any time you want.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Danyerz dude, half of those levels are impossible with speed hacks even if it was slowed down to 0.000000000000000000000000001 of the speed... the creators just made a hack that let them upload it without beating it or made a hack that starts them upside down with a wave portal at the top]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Boomercrazy43 True dat true dat]

commentpurifier.html:34 [just cuz they r smarter than humans doesnt mean they can rapidly tap a phone/click a mouch/tap the space bar]
commentpurifier.html:34 [+Boomercrazy43¬†Well, a dolphin could beat these "impossible" levels.]
commentpurifier.html:34 [how the fuck does that make a difference?]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Boomercrazy43¬†If they are beatable with hacks, or practice mode, they are possible without hacks.]

commentpurifier.html:34 [+Boomercrazy43¬†No, if you beat it, slowing it down or not, it's possible without hacks.]

I make the level, and someone with expertise maybe outfit the level however they please, based around the layout. If this gets reported, I don't care, honestly. But I want help with this.

commentpurifier.html:34 [Let's me get this straight. I don't care if you have more stars than me. Plus, Bloodbath is the hardest DEMON in Geometry Dash. The link Miracle gave you has unrated levels that are humanly impossible and much harder than Bloodbath. They are possible, but you would need supernatural powers to beat them. The hardest level (not demon) is Silent Engine I.]

Therefore the Top #1,in this case Michigun, is the player that have who has more stars globally, that is why he is in the top #1.  Example: Some people beat Water Temple by Michigun with 2500 attempts, but nobody has beaten Bloodbath by Riot.
