 [Guys... Bloodbath was nerfed, look at the blue orb at 1:20 vs 3:33, before you dislike or whatever, just look..]
 [HOW I PLAYED IT AND GOT 1%]
 [Riot might have beaten Bloodbath legit, as you can see in Michigan's part in the UFO and the ship he goes to far into the blocks I tested it he went to far in same with the UFO, also in the preview at the end at 3:34 the orb appears to be further down so he buffed Nerfed Bloodbath]
 [Found a noclipping part 1:51 the spike if you pause at the right time]
 [It’s nerfed. He moved the blue orb in the ball part]
 [GIVE HIM 200K]
 [It takes him 2 minutes to recollect. That's some real dedication.]
 [Funny thing i only got 1% on bloodbath XD it hard for real]
 [GG BOIIIIIII THAT BLESSING WORKEDDD]

 [He nerfed the level notice the blue orb 1:21-3:34 pause it at those two spots]
 [so many y hours and lives taken for this level to  be verified]
 [Cuanto tardastes en ASEr el nivel]
 [Jur deam cers yetete]
 [on the ship part at 72%]
 [he went through the spikes]
 [hax hax hax hax hax hax hax  hax hax hax hax hax hax hax hax]
 [Impossible]
 [This should be a world record or something holy shit man.]
 [Good job c: and even though it’s 2years ago I still believe in him if he makes harder levels]
 [That reaction 😂😂😂]
 [3:44 respiration intenficies]
 [Guys I am the riot mobile player I play on mobile and my name is RiotJNG search me up on gd]
 [U nurfd it]
 [Almost 3 years, and it is still one of the hardest demons..]
 [12th August 2015,      it was Wednesday ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [Wow you beated it at 34 att]
 [once he verfiy the level sound like he was having a heart attack]
 [Gung]
 [4.4 million views =$$$$$$$$$$$$]

 [Riot the AMAZING BLOOD BATH IS MY FAVORITE]
 [Do silent bloodbath Like if u agree]
 [So fake GUYS YOU'RE ALL BEING TRICKED COS THIS LEVEL WAS NERFED!!!=_==_==_= When he mentioned his fails in the last fail clip where he missed the blue orb TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF THAT BLUE ORBS POSITION BESIDE THE SPIKE!!! Now play his completion footage AND PAUSE AT THE EXACT AREA TOWARDS THE END WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE BLUE ORB IN THE COMPLETION FOOTAGE! COMPARE THIS TO THE SCREENSHOT AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE ORB WAS MOVED TO NOT BE BESIDE TUE SPIKE...BUT UNDER IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE GAP JUST SO HE COULD MAKE THAT HARD JUMP EASIER FOR HIMSELF. Guys you need to check this out yourself a cos this is a total SCAM. Next time you see something like this where a YouTuber completes a demon level cos the level s are so fast and complicated ITS EASY FOR YOUTUBERS LIKE ROIT TRICK YOU INTO THINKING THEY CAN DO THE IMPOSSIBLE! That is All. Adios Amigos]

 [Видишь ли... Мир полон скилловых людей, которые проходят очень сложные демоны. Несколько лет назад этот демон считался самым сложным в игре, но люди (ГДешеры, играющие в эту игру) уже продвинулись куда дальше.  Если раньше Bloodbath стоял на 1 месте в топе сложнейших демонов, то уже в 2018-ом его и в топе 20 нету. Ведь время идёт, а уровни создаются сложнее и сложнее. Вот так вот) Кстати, у меня на нём 11%)))]

 [Practice is for practice. Levels have to be completed in one run. Just think about it. If this was applied in real life, if you took a test... One question wrong, redo the question. Another wrong, redo the question...  And so on until you had every question right. This would take no effort.]
 [StopStart the good ol’ day’s]

 [Looks like riot forgot his inhaler and fainted....   LOL😂]
 [Riot im not doubting you can do itt!!!]
 [This level revolutionized Geometry Dash. It was a high-quality level by many amazing creators, and it was built to be the hardest thing ever beaten in the history of GD. With 4 million views on YouTube and over 6 million downloads on GD, it was mind-blowing to see. This made the community bigger and stronger, by showing that what was once thought to be impossible, can be done. This blew up Riot as well. Riot had been doing amazing things, but this was by far the biggest. He got huge fame and respect among the community, and he deserved it. This inspired many more hard levels to be made (e.g. Bloodlust, Aftermath, Sonic Wave Buffdate, etc). This was an amazing achievement, not just on GD, but in gaming in general. Although this level has fallen off the top 10 on the hardest demons list, its legacy still lives.  So thanks to Weoweoteo, Vermillion, Michigun, Evasium, Crack, ASonicMen, Etzer, Havok, Giron David, Gboy and Riot. Also, best of luck to anyone who has beating this, is attempting this, or is planning to beat this in the future.  And once more, thanks Bloodbath, for making GD what it is today <3]
 [dead]
 [My record its 1%. U ARE PRO I SUB NOW!!!]
 [2:29]
 [Nice job don’t understand why I’m saying this in 2017]
 [Lol, noob, I beat Stereo Madness!  Lol jk, good job riot]
 [RIOT DID IT!!!!!!! :D]
 [Hey guys is the most dislike level is the hardest one hardest than the bloodbath]
 [3:20 epic rotate XD]
 [This is truly amazing that you beat this. I think it's amazing that you could accomplish this. I've heard that it took you over 8,000 attempts to complete Clubstep. (One of) the best player in Geometry Dash took 8,000 attempts to beat the simplest demon level. I don't find that embarrassing, I find that motivational to players that feel like they can't beat even the simplest demons. Even me. I have yet to be Clubstep and I'm currently going for Deadlocked (I know Deadlocked is way harder and should do Clubstep first but I'm better at Deadlocked.) And when I feel sad I'm just like: 'Hey, the best friggin' player in the game was like me once. And it took him over 8,000 attempts to do it. And look where that got him!' So I just thought about how you're one of the best Geometry Dash players out there and inspire so many people to become better at this game. PS, what are your thoughts on Bloodlust? You think that level is interesting?]
 [Can't wait to aee EVW beating it]
 [When I beat fingerdash I was like “eh doesn’t matter...” when I beat stereo madness I was like “OMG I DID IT!”]

 [And Im here struggling with jumper]
 [Pin me]
 [Ez]
 [Guys guess what, the only reason he verified it was because i was watching his video of him verifying it. #mindblown]
 [I have seen some videos that said bloodbath was impossible on tablet but I have completed bloodbath on my tablet I just do not have a YouTube channel.]
 [I LOVE YOU RIOT YOU ARE THE BEST!]

 [YAY U DID IT RIOT]
 [You know, despite this level being extremely difficult and still looks good in 2017, I feel like it is overrated. I have gotten 27% in normal mode and my hardest demon is nine circles. This is probably just me, since I am terrible at everything except the ship, specifically the wave, and there are no hard wave parts in BloodBath.]
 [harder then bloodbath...]
 [Damn, this is such a big achievement still today, that's just absolutely  amazingly incredible]
 [Take a break from bloodbath]
 [The reaction I got by beating dynamic on track. (Joke)]
 [This is such an incredible achievement. Riot this is for you. This is your gift to us. This is what you deserve after all these months and years. If you can do this. You can do anything]
 [I've have felt your pain, I did bloodbath in practice mode for the whole level and got 1466 attempts. Now I cannot feel my finger.]

 [Melfy Gaming sure but Riot still assisted on making the level -_-]

 [oh ok... but then again it'd still be more impressive if someone who didn't assist on making this level were to complete it]
 [England Is My City he created part of it but it wasn't only him. It was a megacollab including gboy, Riot, Michigun, Etzer, Vermilion, and many others]
 [Are you fucking braindead or just retarded?]

 [For a game that I thought would be completely unsuccessful, even hated. Had grown to a world wide trend. We actually beat the total players in Minecraft official. Wow. Then even more my game started to grow even more. With 1 player with a potential to slay the greatest of demons created. 1 level that has grown more and more every day. Thousands, Millions of attempts and crashes not even. Until one day, One player changed the entire history of my game. Thank you Riot for making a complete change in our community, you will never be a forgotten player in our history and timeline. -Robtopgames 2017 ~Comment copypasted by Sir Sxni :3]

 [Girlgamer's ROBLOXplay is it The Nightmare?]
 [there is big difference between race  and fucking nacionality i have nothing agains spanish ppl]
 [xNexxy GD You are acting kind of racist, it is Spanish not "alien language", plus it seems like you can't even talk English properly ("englisch"). Also, this is not medium demon on 144hz, this is still extreme.]
 [xNexxy GD   okay okay, You see that you are problematic, so there I leave it, it was just an opinion]

 [Riot you live ?]
 [riot is the master and the God of gd]
 [I would accidentally place a block then hit save with my dumbass]
 [Team Name GeoStorm]
 [Ahhh I remember the good old times where this was the hardest demon ever. Demons today are just the most flashing is the hardest because they make you so blind that it makes easier levels impossible. Old times were better.]
 [quack :v]
 [Yay 😊]
 [IMPOSSIRBU]
 [you even more suck than sunix and i hate you so much]
 [omg then theres me trying to complete toe2]
 [le dio un orgasmo XD AL FINAL, LIKE POR ESO]

 [what's this? https://gyazo.com/286811b56c6838532d586fb7629eca58]
 [was it made in 1.9 or 2.0]
 [What was that song in the beginning called]

 [3:43 cierra los ojos y piensa 7u7]
 [suscribance a mi canal]
 [Thats impossible, how do you have the leva trail when 2.1 came out at the end of 2016]
 [Shitty bloodbath is easy]
 [Riot THE BEST)]
 [I know this was legit and Riot wasn't hacking, but his trail looks glitchy, or is it me being a noob?]
 [Whoah]
 [Nostalgia :' )]
 [Riot is a hacher don't like him]
 [Bloodbath = 9 Letters  Yatagarasu = 10 Letters   So...10-9=1  Michigun = 1 (In Leaderboard) Michigun Likes 3 Spikes...And  Illuminati has 3 edges = ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED!  EDIT: I know Michigun is second but if I put Shaggy23 Likes spikes it won't really make sense lol that's y I support Michi for 1st place...]
 [I belived in riot go riot!!!]
 [It's so hard my high score is 2]
 [3:21 DO A BARREL ROLL]

 [the gd video with more views????]
 [omg]
 [10565740]
 [Congrats you made THE hardest demon ever]
 [This is still, by far, one of the most important things to happen in Geometry Dash.  Nothing is impossible. We learned this after seeing Riot beat this level.   After all this time, I still say GG. And to think, this comment would have never happened if Cataclysm wasn't a reality]
 [hi riot love your videos]
 [At the point u verified it, u almost died of succes]
 [extra long wtf?]
 [Kas po think about what you say jerk bag]
 [Kas po don't  be a jerk to us or don't act like  YOU can beat it]
 [Kas po shut your  mouth and don't respect anyone -_-]
 [Kas po you are idiot]
 [ XD your welcome some people needs to learn that some one is have busy life and won't have time to practice old demon heck I'm so busy I only finish one demon in my channel]
 [Kas po Thank you]
 [Kas po You do realize your comment  is irrelevant what your saying effects who you are and plus just because it's out doesn't mean people have to finish it some of us have busy life you know]
 [Vern Russel Forcrey a]
 [SMELLY TELLY you are a IDIOT]
 [SORRY BRO BUT UR THE IDIOT SO WHAT IF WE ARE LATE?I FINISHED THIS LEVEL LOL.. I SURVIVED.. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [IM NOT AN IDIOT!! 😈😈😈]
 [Songoku Kami1234 yeah]
 [Songoku Kami1234 oh]
 [Kas po well  so  what  it's  still  a  nice thing to say. And only  idiots  worship  the  devil  instead  of  God . We're  not  idiots  :3]
 [Sleepy Marbles it was sarcasm]
 [Ооалалла Алаоа that was 2 years ago..your so fucking late]
 [congrats!!! GG!]
 [Matt814211 l⃡o⃡l⃡]
 [AngeX GD bubblebath]

 [congrats]
 [Kas po  Hypocritical]
 [True xd]

 [Kas po shut up]
 [it doesn't matter when you say congrats]
 [Kas po 2.1 noobs XD]
 [Kas po dat one time ur lvl was titled "the hardest level on gd" then yatagarasu and bloodlust take over]
 [congrats]
 [Salty much?]
 [Kas po Aww so cute! :D]
 [Just Because I Commented At This Time Doesn't Meen I'm Late. I Was Going Back To See The Old Days When Riot Was Considered A God. I Was Here Right When This Was Verified. Think A Little Bit Before What You Say, Cause You Could Be Late Too.]
 [Kas po so are u]
 [Konstantinos Spitieris *cough* yatagarasu *cough*]
 [When you reply to your own comment 3 times ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [You difeted BloodBath]
 [See you did it]
 [i new it]
 [XavierBrownie a virus :D i guest it.... seriously hell nah]
 [XavierBrownie a virus.]
 [atur chomicz what?]
 [A butter Stick!]
 [Wat the]
 [ok]
 [gabrielle de Vries T R I G G E R E D]
 [gabrielle de Vries  It's not the hardest anymore, bloodlust is but it hasn't been verified. The hardest verified level right now is Yatagarasu, but if bloodlust gets verified then that'll be the new hardest]
 [si0 si0 1.9]

 [IT"S SWAG GET IT RIGHT]

 [A8CJF  cuack XD]
 [Caps]
 [Danang Wibisono d]
 [So am I!!]
 [Same]
 [Danang Wibisono im riots fan as well]
 [C R I N G E]
 [Danang Wibisono first. Stop using all caps. It's very annoying and makes your comment hard to read. Second. Riot quit because of pain in his hand, not because of sunix. Third. Why say "GMD?" It makes no sense. It's Geometry Dash, not GeoMetry Dash. Sorry for ranting, this comment just annoyed me.]
 [I think he quit because of finger pain, not Sunix. And he may have returned because of Buffbath.    And please don't type in all caps. ;v]
 [Dank Memes  Yeah but yesterday when i played geometry dash, i saw the sign that Riot is back after the hacking was over. He changed his icons and saw his status in his profile that he would make silent akbar and maybe he will verify it]
 [Danang Wibisono you realize riot might not see this]
 [hey Riot, 2.1 is released you are now playing geometry dash 2.1 with new level fingerdash by robtop and there are many quests, daily levels, orbs, shops, diamonds, more vaults, treassure, rewards, and many more]
 [xFayzinq he expained it in the cataclysm video desc]
 [Sanity its supposed to happen]
 [riot is a he not a she]
 [Sanity that's supposed to happen, lol it's part of the level.]
 [Cancer 1243 l o l]
 [Cancer 1243 Whats wrong with that]
 [Cancer 1243 true]
 [Cancer 1243 nothing wrong with that...]
 [It's because you play mine craft]
 [xFayzinq 144hz monitors do that]
 [iShark1000 oh right thanks.]
 [RelentlessFury_ That happens on 144Hz monitors.]

 [VirinaGames HE WAS RESTING ON SPIKES GOING THROUGH SPIKES AND HE WAS USING LONG JUMP LOOK CLOSELY!!!!!!!!!!!]
 [pandabear moose why's he a hacker? I mean, Riot didn't hack he's just pro at flying. Cyclic also didn't hack at Sonic Wave. And TrusTa didn't at Yatagarasu.]
 [pandabear moose You're a hacker]

 [Riot. I want you to make the new hardest level called "geometrical M"]

 [3:43 - 3:50 was something banging on you.]
 [Now he needs to 2.1-ify it, lol jk, he does whatever he wants.]
 [The demon levelsBloodbath and Cataclysm are red, gray and black. That means blood and gore, probably hell. But 'At the speed of light' sounds like a space theme. Well, I would prefer this as space. ANY SPACE LEVELS WITH THIS SONG?]
 [FOR ALL PROS: I made an ultimate wave challenge just for pros. Its called: "wave massacre" by xflexiblex (me). Its not rated yet so please help me ;) its nearly impossible it took me 5k attempts( its tiny) and I used a special 2 finger play system wich lets me control the wave extremely fast. Its not impossible...its a challenge for the real pros in the game..noone has beat it yet.. be the first one ;) good luck...]
 [HOWWWWWWWWWWWW?!?!?!?!??!?!?!]

 [This is the most important level in geometry dash history. These players are the best of all time]
 [MY BRO BEAT BLOODBATH]
 [I saw this the day it came out]
 [Geometry Dash  It stopped working :v]
 [Not only you]
 [try this on a phone]
 [2017 wow this is from the future]
 [Zoff]
 [Nope I'm here]
 [Riot... is the true legend.]
 [most viewed geometry dash video I think]
 [im almost done with blast processing when i get to this maybe 2-10 million years or soo]
 [It would've been funny if he died at the last spike, lol.]
 [Here we go Bloodbath       Lvl 1  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) gg]
 [Check out my account xprogamer123 I know it's a bad name I made it like 3 years ago😂]
 [*OH MY GOD* HEEEUUU HEEUUUU  HEUUUUUU HEUUUU  *Disappears*]
 [i'm supposed to beat bloodbath, but this one spike keeps kikking my ass!]
 [what...... Quak xD]
 [*QUACK*]
 [I remember the says when I looked at this and said: "Wow I'm too behind on this game to ever catch up to these type of demons."    And here I am with it completed... ;) oh the hell I suffered through... I still, to this very day, can't believe that I have completed this hell. And I had like only 5k stars when I did this. 13,678 attempts... it's over. (My reaction sucked by the way... It sounded something like this,"GG!" *falls on floor*.)]
 [in the end though...imagine being a player and read "GG <3 RIOT" And then die by the spike next to it. that would be to crazy]
 [I beat this level]
 [#RIOTGASM]
 [Aré you the creator OMG i passed your demon i love that level]
 [take a breath]
 [This don't seem too bad it is just how fast you are and how hard it is to focus at some times.]
 [gg]
 [fuck you]
 [2:30 swag.]
 [ur fucking breathing hurt my ears]
 [It's 2017th  for me to]
 [hax? no one nows]
 [Have any of you noticed that his trail is the fire trail from 2.1? Wierd, this was posted in 2015. :/]
 [Still waiting for that video...]
 [once again good job]
 [swag.]
 [can i download that reaction?]
 [Guys hes a hacker dont get tricked!]
 [hacker]
 [I think Bloodbath will forever be the hardest level known to man. (Unless RioT decides to go insane and make a harder level, then verifies it) EDIT: I did not know many big levels when I made this comment. Also, I think Orochi will probably be the hardest for a while. (If it is verified)]
 [Epic awesome and riot is with us]
 [wait he touched the spikes and did not die right here 3:10 are you hacking?]
 [EPIC PRO MADNESS TOO MUUUUUUCCCHHHH COOOOLNEEESSSSS 😱😱😱😱😲😲😲]
 [I really don't understand why they say Athanatos and Sakupen Hell is harder... When I look at both levels, I just see Athanatos very easy as well as Sakupen Hell. And I still see Bloodbath way harder. Just because someone says something us harder than Bloodbath doesn't mean it is harder than Bloodbath. For example, TrusTa said that Sakupen Hell was harder than Bloodbath just to get attention and become more famous and he also wanted to feel like he has done something way better as well as Aurorus with Athanatos. Bloodbath is harder than Athanatos and Sakupen Hell]
 [The 4th Hardest demon... After a year, Bloodbath was considered the impossible, now it's not... Artificial Ascent in 3rd place, Sonic wave in 2nd and Yatagarasu in 1st... But there will be no demon level with a greater and darker story than Bloodbath. Not even Bloodlust.]
 [swag]
 [GG! I can't pass this level in practise (35 minutes and 21% T_T). I ask you for something: are you one of creators of GD? I think you are, but I don't know. YOU ARE THE BEST GD PLAYER EVER!]
 [GUYS I DEFEATED BLOODBATH TOO GO TO MY CHANNEL!!]
 [Riot i finally beat bloodbath after 76k attempts]
 [Hell nah]
 [как музон называется  после раунда?]

 [Sup riot]

 [I have 90% on deadlocked (normal mode) and 100% (practice mode) and 3.4K attempts]
 [YOU CAN DO IT RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]

 [Ω ΔιαηDυδγLΞηηγGυγ Ω There are six levels harder than this one wich are possible. 7.- Bloodbath 6.- The Hell World 5.- sakupen hell 4.- Athanatos 3.- Artificial acent 2.- Sonic Wave 1.- Yatagarasu.]
 [Ω ΛιαnDυdγGαmΞrGυγ Ω  Your comment would've been understandable if you made it at the time this was made but there are way harder levels than Bloodbath now]
 [Ω ΛιαnDυdγGαmΞrGυγ Ω there are even harder levels, like silent levels, but the hardest possible level is yatagarasu atm]

 [UltraQuasar your a fake ya twat never discredit the best players.]
 [Jairaj Lallaramnauth lmao you're so false no one spends even 500k attempts on a level. It took me 13,678 attempts to beat Bloodbath and unlike you, my completion is actually real.]
 [Geometry Dash Gutter calm down]
 [Jason Mathews do you realize how fucking late you are. not to mention the fact that everyone fucking knows]
 [dude i can't believe it after 9m plus attempts i finaly beat blood bath]
 [also trusta]
 [DiegoxDash he still is]
 [Jason Mathews no cataclysm is no he'll themed level including bloodbath sakupun hell after math artificial ascent hell factory bizarre phantasm yatagarsu and bloodlust the best players would be riot krazyman50 and gd archane]
 [CreeperBeast200 no riot confirmed on a stream that he said swag]
 [Geometry Dash StopStart actually they say "Quack]
 [UltraQuasar .au]
 [Jason Mathews yeah this level also started the way everyone always says "sweg" after michignu's part]
 ["Yagrasu"     Be right back I have some things to do... Like for example lose my faith in humanity before I suicide.]
 [Jason Mathews  NOPE YAGRASU IS NEXT *Lenny face*]
 [Jason Mathews I'd say stereo madness is more important ;)]
 [Mini Plush Skits I find cataclysm more important then funnygame holiday but I find revolution slightly more important than cataclysm]
 [Kax nope cataclysm was an inspiration to bb cataclysm is also what gave Riot motivation to do make bb and beat it]
 [Jason Mathews no cataclysm is more important than bb by far]
 [This level is not *so* special anymore.]
 [AdsGD I think not, bloodbath is one of most important levels of gd and riot is a leyend of gd or was]
 [You're a bit late buddy]
 [Jason Mathews agreed]
 [dat straight flying skill man]
 [eres el puto crack]

 [Wow, RioT. It's been an entire year since Bloodbath was uploaded, and the community is still cheering you on. Instead of making a "Back on Track is harder" joke, I want to give you a round of applause. Don't just sit there, claiming your victory. Do something. Update Bloodbath and make it with a 2.0 style. Whatever you can do, make it better. RioT, this is amazing. G. Flippin'. G.  What? You thougt a "QuacK" joke? Nah. RioT's too cool for that.]

 [GW VortexBT[Geometry Dash]  I personally thing he sayd "quack" because he is secretly a duck...      Did i sayd i got 90% on bloodbath...        Oh, you dont believe me?        Actually i suck at lying soo yeah...        ...        ...         ...        Why are you still reading this?          ...        ,,,         I like turtles :3           ...         Now thats awkward.         ...         Why are you still reading?           Oh, cuz the comment is super long and no matter how much you are scrolling down, it just keeps on and on and on             And on            And on            And on            And on             And on              And on              And on              And on              And on              And on             And off            And on            And on             And on             And on              And on               And on               And on              And on             And on               And on               And on!...             What if i told you that there was one "and off" in all of these "and on"s...             If:  1- you was scrolling like mad, you probably didnt saw it and went back to see it.   2- you was strange enough to read every single one of the "and on"s and you saw it before... Why did you red all of them, thats pointless...                                                                                                                                                                                .                                                                                                                                                                                            Did you saw the dot?                 If you scrolled back, trying to find it then...                WHY???              Oh, because...                       Ok then, bye.]

 [my reaction when I beat can't let go]
 [Оргазм в конце!]
 [Hey guys, I'm not trying to spam or anything, but how do you make the levels start when the music is like, far away from when the music started? Like the music Riot used for Bloodbath started a different way then it did in the level, which mean Riot started the level by using a different part of the music then the start, so how do you do that? If you know how to, then definitely answer me please :)]
 [Good job]
 [Rest In Peace Riot.😭😭😭]

 [Riot=duck confirmed]
 [shut up fag]
 [missmichel j      Yep]
 [*or his young cousin put a start pos right at the start* (Happened to me on my lvl :v)]
 [No]
 [Hell doesn't exist, nor does Jesus. When you die you rot end of story.]
 [Cola Gaming Your explanation proves and means nothing retarded atheist. There's nothing your braindead ass can do to change my belief. I will not listen to an atheist explaining the same, ignorant stupid shit every other clueless atheist would say. But I'll win in the end, cause you'll burn in hell. Btw, "free will" covers up half your dumb explanation.]
 [Shut your stupid ass up. You make absolutely no sense. Alright let's take a look outside, crime, pollution, corruption everywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if all of Earth's resources are gone in a few decades. A President is restricting entire countries from entering his domain, and I bet half the people that are in those restricted countries are highly praying to their "savior" just be ignored as the problems within "God's Gift" (Earth) continues. Where was God when Hitler rose to power and killed off millions of his devoted followers? He was nowhere. Now let's look at the universe, and the vastness of space what makes Earth so significant? There are plenty of planets capable of sustaining life(Kepler-186f is just 1 example), so did he make clones of himself for every other planet? seems unlikely. And bruh, the bible. One of the most contradictory books every written and you're gonna use that to justify the existence of god? Alright, so who wrote the bible? "Uhhhhh, Jesus' disciples" And how do you know that? "Uhhhhh, because it said it in the bible". So you're saying that if I wrote a book, and in that book I say that I'm a dragon are you gonna believe me? No. It doesn't make sense. "how could they possibly make all of our history up in that book" Said a not so wise man. Half of the explanations they have in the book have been proven incorrect. Let's look at the bible's explanation for rainbows, "The Biblical meaning of the colors of the rainbow are that red signifies sin, orange means evil, yellow stands for eternal life and purple signifies loyalty. In addition, in the Biblical context, the colors of the rainbow taken as a whole signify God's covenant with man to never again destroy the world with a flood." Yeahhhhh, nice try but no, you're all wrong. This is the actual explanation for rainbows, "We see rainbows because of the geometry of raindrops. When the sun shines from behind us into the rain, incident rays of light enter the drop and are refracted inwards. They are reflected from the back surface of the raindrop, and refracted again as they exit the raindrop and return to our eyes. Refraction is responsible for splitting the sunlight into its component colors." Your argument is invalid, God doesn't exist.]
 [Foxy the djYT riot took more than 10000 at WHAT THE FUDGE]
 [The Black Soul sorry for being such s dick, i was just in a bad mood and i respect your beliefs]
 [+Tiny Duck Games It would honestly be impossible for an atheist to change my belief. I'm not saying you should change what you believe, that's your damn choice. Just the comparison between Christians, atheists, and Satanic ppl I've met, atheists are easily the most asshole, dumbest ppl I've met. What exactly do you think made us? Apes some ppl say? Well what do you think created the apes then? I may respect your belief, but I do not respect how you treat mine. Honestly, the only possible explanation to everything in existence is a god. God's also can't be "created" either, and it's obvious that you know hardly all that much about the bible, and I'm retarded to believe what ancient ppl have seen and wrote in an ancient book? It seems more retarded to not believe it tbh. All around the world is believing there's a god to this current day. ]
 [The Black Soul Are you retarded, Why do you belive something is true from a Fucking 2000 year book. also, if god made everything, what made god. Also a flaw in the bible, if god created the sun on the 4th day how had 4 days passed?]
 [What if the" lord" is a construct of someone who want to believe there's hope. Ever thought about that?]
 [+Cola Gaming​ Hmm.. Go outside, grass, animals, trees, water, dirt, and many things that didn't just appear. Read the fucking bible, how could they possibly make all of our history up in that book? How can they give every detail of the human race history? There's your proof, misguided one. Every atheist I've ever met seemed to be a complete dumbass. ]
 [The Black Soul The fact that there is no tangible proof of his existence]
 [Derek Choy That's your belief. Don't state it like it's a fact. What makes atheists think God doesn't exist?]

 [Wow guys... I'm actually speechless. Months of work have gone into verifying and building the level, I really don't know what to say. I still can't believe I have done it. I wish the best of luck to those who want to suffer the hell I did with this level, it's not pleasant. I owe all my motivation to Michigun.. without him I would have given up easily. He was there whenever I needed help to continue and carry on, thank you michigun. So I guess the question is... whats next? the next chapter for me is in 2.0, so stay tuned....  Also a quick shoutout to the team that built this level with me, they are amazing builders, and supported me throughout the whole journey, so here they are in order from start to finish:  Weoweoteo: 1:51 - 2:00 Vermillion: 2:00 - 2:18 Michigun: 2:18 - 2:29 Evasium: 2:29 - 2:42 Crack: 2:42 - 2:54 AsonicMen: 2:54 - 3:09 Etzer: 3:09 - 3:17 Havok: 3:17 - 3:27 GironDavid: 3:27 - 3:33 Gboy: 3:33 - 3:40 RioT: 3:40 - 3:41]

 [a long ago? you mean long ago with you the 'a' lmfo nub gtfo were the cool preteens grammar nazi]

 [Jos athanatos isnt harder than bb]
 [yeah kys xdxd]
 [+T!gerBoy Gam1ng Kill yourself.]
 [Jos Back on Track was always the hardest level and will always be (old meme)]

 [can you kids just shut the fuck up? it's like growing sea monkeys and watching them grow mental]
 [i regret commenting this, look at what a fucking shitwar i've formed]
 [+Skellter Just fucking shut up because I ojos guay Black Blizzard is More dificult than Yatagarasu fucking dumb 8)]
 [hitter click is easy anyway... just tap fast...]
 [Cesar Alexis that DOESNT make it harder than Yatagarasu wtf. How can u be so dumb. NOT EVERY EXTEREME DEMON UPCOMONG IS THE HARDEST. SAME SHIT WAS WITH AI AND IT ENDED #15]
 [+Skellter you are fucking stupid Black Blizzard has participado of hitter click >:(]
 [Jos Athanatos isnt harder. But Sakupen Hell was always harder]
 [No, but you'd be better than you were before.]
 [Greek Bust that doesn't say anything at all, because that would mean that if i had a 144 hz monitor i would be better than krazy or guillester e.g.]
 [Mlg7803 GD You have no physical fucking proof, so you cant say anything. We can only go by the videos posted online. Also, how would krazy verify it if it was harder than yata? He is a 60hz player.]
 [Skellter that is because of boj and bloodlust but it is harder than yata.]
 [Mlg7803 GD WHO everybody ? Stupid kids like you. The community thinks that every upcoming extreme demon is nr1 like Artificial Ideolgy and it endid up on #15. So stfu. Pro players say  even Krazy say that Black Blizzard will end up top 5 on #3 or #4.]
 [Skellter everybody says it is, dont get triggered lol]
 [Mlg7803 GD you are a fucking idiot if u think like that.]
 [Skellter it is]
 [Cesar Alexis wtf are you stupid ? Black Blizzard isnt even out yet. And Balck Blizzard isnt harder than Yatagarasu]
 [Cesar Alexis lol nope, black blizzard isnt even out yet lol]
 [Vale Pirez but yatagarasu was replaced by Black Blizzard]
 [it has been replaced by yatagarasu]
 [Mlg7803 GD I'm doing bloodbath right now, and I can say with experience that Sakupen Hell is harder. The waves are unlike anything seen in BB. BB is long, which means each part is easier. If all you've done are practice runs, then I can't take that as evidence when I've practiced both demons.]
 [also this proof is unstable but:  bloodbath first practice run: 1400+ attempts sakupen hell first practice run: ~400 attempts]
 [GD Yelooh no it isnt, even though the forums say so, how can a medium level beat an xl demon? and now you might say "wave timings". the wave parts take 30 seconds or maybe even less of the level. the rest is super ez.]
 [+Mlg7803 GD Sakupen Hell is harder than Bloodbath.]
 [it was not beaten by athanatos, neither by sakupen hell. number 4 hardest demon]
 [Jos now yatagarasu 😉]
 [Brian Wang yeah but it won't get rated because it's not legit]
 [And someone hack-verified Bloodlust, it's a normal rating on GMD.]
 [[PF] Nicholasb0921 Gaming now?!]
 [Now Yatagarasu is out...]
 [+MirakekkLe I recently got 77% on Cataclysm. At the time this comment was made, it is 22nd... I remember when it was incredible that it got knocked off the top 10...]
 [+GD Yelooh too bad bloodbath is like the 8th hardest level now, once the hell world and artifical ideology get rated lmao. And then maybe the hell zone is stormfly verified that kek]
 [Don't worry BB is higher above Athanatos now]
 [Anayeli Hernandez Sonic wave is harder and longer than sakupen hell.....]
 [+Anayeli Hernandez what about the level from Hell SONIC WAVE]
 [Tunku_Umar your right they are not ready for pure Hell]
 [Sakupen Hell should be #1 for sure]
 [People have skill for bloodbath now but not yet for hell]
 [Ik Sakupen hell is hard but the reason everyone says it's harder than bloodbath is because by this time it's new and many have mastered bloodbath if both of them were released at the same time people will say bloodbath harder]
 [Tunku_Umar nope, its in the top ten demons rn, sakupen hell is WAY harder than you think]
 [Sakupen hell is an extreme demon but it's never harder than he 50th hardest demon as it's only a medium]
 [+Swift Tech I always preffered Sonic Wave before Bloodbath]
 [Jos sonic wave now :(]
 [yeah true but if every demon in 1.9 or earlier had 2.0 theyd all probably be a little buffed, and that means BB]
 [Jos but 2.0 demons have way more harder features to add to levels this will the hardest 1.9 demon]
 [Jos Yeah you might've btw Athanatos is harder than both]
 [Why?! Y athanatos. Y it couldn't be some high quality level ;-;]
 [i think i've started a flamewar, oops]
 [Someone finally gets it! Bloodbath is by far, longer and tigther than both]
 [The only reason hell and athanatos are "harder" or higher up on the demon list is because as of right now there aren't as many completions and they're new, also because they're a lot more cancerous (more spam)]
 [SAKUPEN HELL IS HARDER THAN BLOODBATH AND ATHANATOS]
 [athanatos means immortal in greek. Αθάνατος]
 [Jos yatagarasu]
 [Jos AA isn't garder than BB. (My opinion obviously)]
 [Bloodbath is harder than Athanatos]
 [Athanatos way easier.]
 [Don't you mean Michigun: 2:18 - 2:29 quak: 2:29 - 2:31 Evasium 2:31 - 2:42 :P]

 [Yeah, not so great when someone doesn't read your statement either, is it? Earlier you said I was socially inept for not knowing this was a joke. Later, in your last comment, you clearly said to me "Shut your big mouth up about "roasting" because throwing insults over the internet like it matters is pathetic". Now, if you truly believed that, you wouldn't have attacked me to begin with. You sir, are a hypocrite. Moving on, when I said look in a mirror, I was not referring to the physical face he would see. If he truly meant what he said in the original comment, then he would be a joke as a _person_ and people would laugh at him if he was really that dumb.]
 [+Geometry Dash Evilflame You obviously didn't read the later part of my statement.]
 [BOI I was not talking to you.  "_untitldAug 2, 2016 1 Reply +Geometry Dash Evilflame It was a sarcastic comment, but i'm curious... roast me now, I'm quite hungry and a roast is what I really need right now"  Do some research.]
 [+Geometry Dash Evilflame Are you talking to me? even if you aren't you don't even know what he looks like. Shut your big mouth up about "roasting" because throwing insults over the internet like it matters is pathetic]
 [Oh I never saw that you asked me to roast you. Okay, here we go.  "What a joke!" Bitch please if you want a really good joke go look in the fucking mirror.]

 [+Angelo Cangero oh my rub rub, this guy is our new lord.]
 [r u dumb, i can beat level 6 on first try]
 [+Geometry Dash Evilflame It was a sarcastic comment, but i'm curious... roast me now, I'm quite hungry and a roast is what I really need right now]
 [That wasn't my point. Claiming that by beating Stereo Madness in 4 attempts on a good day as a MUCH higher achievement than Bloodbath is fucking retarded. Not to mention he said most people can't and the that we are all mere mortals. Now, if he is joking, I won't have to roast him.]

 [haxor only cyclic can do that]
 [wow, I found my comment after a year, forgot I posted this loooooool.]
 [TriTron_ yeah and the fact is those youtubers were still not great at verifying demon levels so they tried to rate it insane or demon so the easy levels now are demons... I verified the lightning road and the nightmare legitaly]
 [GD Kingdavid3241 -ZenthicAnagramZ48 theres no silent]
 [Sevolger9903 Dear Nostalgist will be a demon because so many people failed on the hardest parts of it... Even i failed on 54%]
 [yeh]
 [Sevolger9903 True, but atleast we got a few ezy 10 stars from those other ones :D]
 [Rekt]
 [your mom's a real demon in bed]
 [Sevolger9903 this isn't a real demon this is  impossible. Real demons are like ultraviolet or cataclysm, this is just too hard.]
 [...]
 [I real demon hacked by a piece of shit known as Anaban]
 [Doctor Orange yeah!]
 [You mean... E X T R E M E  D E M O N]
 [BB rated Demon to the power of Demon]
 [Actually, when considering how the REGULAR levels are rated, they should be rated IDK, Hard? Very hard?]
 [I know that, but I will still call it a 1.3 level because of the gameplay]
 [The Pink One But it was updated at 1.7]
 [The nightmare was originally 1.3]
 [I meant the other ones.]
 [Doctor Orange Lightning Road was done at 1.3, Nightmare at 1.7]
 [Those demons were in 1.9.]
 [well to Rubrub Blast processing, geometrical dominator, Xstep, and electroman adventures are demons because 10*]
 [I agree. Dear nostalgists may be hard but should be rated insane. I have completed dear nostalgists, now i am working on nine circles. My best is 68%. After i beat nine circles im gonna complete your level riot!! if i do ill have video proof. But good job on completing bb riot!]
 [I've seen harder well now I do]
 [+Sky Blue Productions They are impossible]
 [+neWaselu I think there should be a max of 15 stars, 10 for easy demon, 15 for insane demon]
 [that's why RobTop is planning to add new icons in 2.2 (easy demon, medium demon, hard demon) but it will still count as demon]
 [+[GD]Kiantheboss  furry is a fag you had Adiale saying GG like we all know its legit]
 [+Slimshady thanks I honestly appreciate it...tell that to furrydash :/]
 [+[GD]Kiantheboss i feel you, honestly you beat bloodbath who cares you beat an extreme demon you should be allowed to tell the world]
 [+Slimshady Thanks man. Maybe I seem like an attention whore for "advertising" my video but Bloodbath put me through so much stress and all I want is for people to know that I beat it too. This one guy Furry Dash is hating on me for being an "attention whore" but honestly idgaf.]
 [+[GD]Kiantheboss its all good man, and honestly i did think you were baiting people to go to your channel but then i checked the video out, bu then i just kind of started messing around sorry about that, and gg dude]
 [+Slimshady You seemed very serious too, haha maybe I'm too gullible.]
 [+Slimshady Sorry just there has been other people who have kinda been pissing me off. Sorry dude. lol.]
 [+[GD]Kiantheboss and yet you have failed to see that ive literally just pissed you off on purpose... im fucking with you and your letting me]
 [lol bullshit nobody advertises that they just beat the hardest demon in the game]
 [+[GD]Kiantheboss kill yourself :D]
 [Guys I beat Bloodbath yesterday please check it out :)]
 [+ChrispaX Ok!😃]
 [This is a legit demon.]
 [+Lol and btw u seem to be cool :) lemme subscribe to ya. If you have full version you can add me whenever u want. My GD account is CHRISPAX and i have 835 stars]
 [+Lol let me explain... I beat all original levels in geometry dash and i uploaded them all except Deadlocked which i am trying to currently upload with 3 coins. I am a mobile player and i play on an iPad and whenever a reply is added in a comment i replied in it automatically sends me a nitification that someone else replied and it makes a noise and notification noises fade the music and lag the level up and then it gets bugged so then i fail. Wish me luck btw. I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow and i plan to upload the Deadlocked video on youtube before school starts.]
 [+ChrispaX Wait how does this lead to me? I was talking to another guy?!]
 [+Slimshady well mefewe tried to verify it but failed at 98% but i consider that as winning since he at least was 2% away from the finish wall XD]
 [+Lol never mind sorry i will upload it tomorrow... Sorry]
 [+Lol STFU IM TRYING TO UPLOAD DEADLOCKED WITH 3 COINS]
 [+Sky Blue Productions Fucking retard! Silent levels are IMPOSSIBLE! Where do you live? In your mums A$$!]
 [+ChrispaX its never been legitimately beaten]
 [+GD Rare Wubbox umm acyually sonic wave is slightly harder than bloodbath]
 [+Yerik Morales 1. Bloodbath 2. Sonic Wave 3. Death Corridor 4. Cataclysm 5. Back on Track? (Lenny)]
 [and Death Corridor? :v]
 [ur right guy]
 [This isnt a demon. This is the HARDEST DEMON]
 [+Kevin Mejia Why should they? The only level in that category will be Bloodbath]
 [Which world do you live in where Silent levels are harder than this? Go pound stones you noob]
 [cant be silent, silent levels are strictly impossible]
 [+Shendelzare MC Bloodbath is one of the hardest maps. It's a true demon. You clearly find the Nightmare way too hard.]
 [you don't know much about geometry dash, Stfu]
 [Oh yeah The Nightmare was way too easy.]
 [Not really, just more stars.]
 [I think rubrub should make another category for levels like these]
 [Of course the nightmare is just hard or harder now, but it was demon in the past, plus there have to be easy demons so you have something to start with. And bloodbath should be rated impossible, lol.]
 [the nightmare and lightning road were rated because back when those levels were made they were considered good]
 [gg]
 [This should be rated extreme demon or silent]
 [3:40 when riot busts a nut and stuff spill yeah]

 [Flannel Mine aren't low, yours are just high lol. Nevertheless, I am and was an experienced hard core gamer before starting GD. I guess the majority who get far are also the same! The rest either give up early on or keep going like you guys despite your huge disadvantage. :/]
 [+Huzi37709 Try going in to gd without having ANY reaction time. 99.9% Chance you played a game to death that required lots of reaction time before gd to get such low attempts.]
 [Geez! You're both terrible lol. It took me like 1.5K for deadlocked and everyone I know is about the same!]
 [+MrTesla1231 I know thats just a joke but dont doubt yourself. Your skill level keeps increasing as you keep clearing the main levels one by one, dont worry about it :)]
 [+Flannel Ok than for me that will be 10k attempts for electrodynamix, and 50k for deadlocked. ]
 [+MrTesla1231 Took me 1.7k for electro-making-me-fucking-insane dynamix, and 5.7k for deadlocked... dont even know how im still a breathing human]
 [+Flannel  Now imagine how many attempts it will take to beat electrodynamix. I don't wawnt to even think about deadlocked.]
 [+MrTesla1231 Damn dude, even i got only 600 for that lmao]
 [MrTesla1231 Well god DAMN! You're on a whole nother level of awful...]

 [Aand now I'm 42% into Dear Nostalgists. This is what a progress spree looks like.  EDIT: 58% BABY]
 [IKR I cant even beat Electrodynamix D:]
 [Cuz they're neerds who play all day and don't have lives]
 [+Huzi37709 Yeah, If you go on to steam logged out and check geometry dash achievements, only 15% of players have actually beaten electrodynamix. (15.4%)]
 [WTF?! 85% NEVER EVEN BEAT ELECTRO DYNAMIX? LMAO!]
 [The channels you see on youtube are all good because they want to show off their rare skill. You do realise that if you have beaten electrodynamix you are literally in the top 15% of all players with the full game xD]
 [Hare to say it, some people can be good at playing it, some will learn much slower than others. Like me, after 6 months I finally beaten Electroman Adventures. I wish I can beat more Demon levels! I only finished Clubstep and Deadlocked. TOE2 is harder.]
 [+NinjaFox Animates (EchoFox5) lol i do my best i just need time to improve]
 [I was talking to +SoulsDash GD​. ]
 [Like  Aweek to get 60% but I think I need a month to beat it because it's my first demon and the space ship part is the most hardest part]
 [How long have you been playing for?]
 [I've beat all Lvls]
 [41% here.]
 [me too im on 60%in clubstep it freaks me over]
 [It takes a REALLY long time to gain this amount of skill. I've been playing for a year and a half and I only made it up to clubstep, and I haven't even completed that yet.]
 [Right Just Do Ur Best]
 [+GD ElectroKnight69 no you dont you just don't try harder]
 [No I suck]
 [What the heck am I getting into now]

 [+MrTesla1231 Let me explain: Wunder Waffe means "Wonder weapon", right? Well, it was a concept in WWII where the Germans could win the war just By one of these, but is not speciffically THE wunderwaffe from BO 1, so this, applied to Geometry Dash, means a level designed to kill the most experienced players ]

 [+Geometry Dash xClockinx if you're trying to "what if", you, at least, need to make it in some sense possible. Well, you can't make a level a different rating without RobTop.

 [+R!DE Yes you can retard]
 [+_Digital shut up, you prick. "What if" still needs to follow some sort of reality. You can't have a "what if" that is easily defied by our rules of whatever. In this case, the rules of Geometry Dash. You should learn how to read, idiot.]

 [Guys, 𝕡𝕝𝕖𝕒𝕤𝕖 𝕤𝕥𝕠𝕡 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕙𝕒𝕥𝕖 in this comments section. If you disagree with the things I am about to say, just dislike and move on to the next comment. There's 𝕟𝕠 𝕡𝕠𝕚𝕟𝕥 𝕚𝕟 𝕔𝕠𝕞𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕠𝕟 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤.

If I beat Bloodbath, I would have the same reaction, and I'm pretty darn sure you would, too  Lastly, give this guy some credit and acknowledgement because he spent a long time creating and verifying this level. 𝕊𝕥𝕠𝕡 𝕞𝕒𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕔𝕠𝕞𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕤 about him having "no life" or someone who can "do better than him" if they obviously cannot.  Once again, I would like to point out that if you do not agree with my judging, leave a dislike and move on to the next comment because there's 𝕟𝕠 𝕡𝕠𝕚𝕟𝕥 𝕚𝕟 𝕔𝕠𝕞𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕠𝕟 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤.]

 [OK, guys. At first, before I maybe say something wrong, I just want you, Riot to know that even if I think of this, you are still my idole and the best GD player in the world. Ok. Starting from, like, 2:00, your ship trail starts to stop for a verry little time. You have to look carefully. That is known as hack. The hack in 1.9 usually affects the trail during playing. So, I don't know if you hacked, because you are gr8 at GD, or maybe it was a bug of 1.9. If you hacked just reply this comment, and tell me. You don't have to be shy. I hacked in my life too]

 [+Step-Uti I never say that Geometry dash is the hardest game]
 [even tho there are way harder games than GD. but I agree with you.]
 [+Legendre Shogun I agree]
 [+Andrew Taing then play fusion cause I beat 17 demons and the main ones are BB super sonic and 72% on cataclysm and 22% on fusion]
 [Please, BB is argueably the most difficult demon in all of GD, and the only other levels that even compete are Phobos and Sonic Wave]
 [Nah. More like "OMFG YOU HACKER GO KILL URSELF" Then Riots fans beat him up :)]

 [Michigun's part easy? Are you out of your mind?]
 [Kinda. Collabs are this: One guy makes his parts. He uploads it and tells his friend the code to copy it. His friends copies it. Other guy deletes level from the internet. Friend adds his part. Repeat with all the collaborators]
 [It's called a Level, not "Map".]

 [+Loul 60 You're not a god, you're not always right.  See that link that I posted above? Yes, it explains everything. That screenshot is real, and as you can see there, Riot said it by himself if he said "Swag" even though it sounds more like quack/kuak/whatever the hell it was.]
 [Why r so many people having an argument about 1 dang word that a geometry dash master (riot) said! From what I heard (and I'm always right 🤓) he said quack/kuak]
 [+Minick 4 welp it sounded like a quack. and thats how the legendary quack has risen! ALL HAIL RIOT]

 [+jake arnolder lol that would be amazing xd]
 [+GabrielGamer BR yea but when you remove it you have to verify it again :P]
 [Actually, if you beat a level with a start pos, the game reminds you, and tells you to remove it before verifying it.]
 [+Vuxifyy oh god dam- dont even]

A circle, a eye is a circle, put another 0 in that eye, put the 2 sideways 0's in the triangle, BLOODBATH AND STEREO MADNESS IS ILLUMINATI COMFORMED! Stereo madness and bloodbath is inside who's game? ROBTOPS! Illuminati inside g dash, Robtop created the game, geometry dash is... ILUMINATI! Life is revealed.]

 [You MUST study this game....]
 [That's an impossible demon I saw your confession video about hacking the game  You deleted the video after two minutes and you reactions are fake that's why everyone should unsubscribe no one can have a reaction time that fast and all of you movements were exact. Just cause you have no skill doesn't mean you need to hack I used to be terrible at geometry dash then I just practiced every day after school and now I'm super good at geometry dash because of how much I practice .practice and you'll get a lot better trust me.infact I'm on deadlocked and once I beat it I'll have beat all the original g-dash levels all you needed to do was practice not hack and that's why you have no skill.

 [Pffft More Like Super Easy Noob Demon, Back on track is harder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [Here's a funny story. So, I'm fairly new at GD, not a pro yet (I finally beat Hexagon Force and Clutterfunk yesterday). I have yet to actually complete a Demon Level. Or even reach halfway through one, and I'm not afraid to admit it. One day, a couple months ago (before I beat Electroman even), I decided to go around and attempt a bunch of Demon levels, to see what kind of damage I could do to them. Bloodbath was one of the first ones I clicked on. After dying at 1% about 50 times, I said to myself, "I can do this. This beginning part is difficult, but I doubt its too hard after it. The furthest I got was 4% before I got frustrated and moved on. Little did I know, this is considered one of the most difficult levels in all of Geometry Dash, and that it is MUCH MORE difficult past the beginning lol. Now, I still want to beat a Demon level (If you have any suggestions of easier Demon levels that I should try, feel free to comment them ;) pls), but I'm not going to try the harder Demons until I'm ready, and I'm not going to let myself stress over them too much, until I beat Electrodynamix (which I currently have 71% on). Once I beat THAT, then I'll focus on beating Demons.]
 [robtop powah!! xD]
 [some guy made a video saying that you hacked but i don't think so you are just really good at the game. he is broadly just can't beat the level. keep up the good work.]
 [WAT ARE DOSE?!!?!?!?!?!?]
 [There Are 6 Levels Of MLGDP (Major League Geometry Dash Player) 1: Beginner 2: Intermediate 3: Pro 4: Expert. 5: Superstar. 6: Master (Only For People Who Are Good As Riot.) What Rank Would You Put Yourself. If You Beated At Least 1 Demon You Should Be At Least At A 3. I'm On 4]
 [Yep i know bloodbath is hardest demon, but not hardest level ever]
 [BloodBath created a new category of demon levels; Extreme Hell demon]

 [la leyenda es real Riot es un pato... O.o]
 ['OH MY GOD' - RioT 2k15]
 [I got 25... :(]
 [Some one make a level called bloodlocked it will be bloodbath and dead locked mixed up]
 [QUACK]
 [Ur a fucking legend]
 [I hate sounds edited in. It ruins the vibe]
 [OMG]
 [Oh sorry I was wrong 😅]
 [Hacker]
 [Haxker]
 [lol]
 [abra una buena persona que me diga como se llama la cancion del minuto 6:02 ?]
 [The intro was way to serious for this phone and computer game xD]
 [u are a fu.... hacker I know if speed it down can see u Madaf... look at your self u hacker dislike all his videos cut his hacking and having lot of money of YouTube all dis is fake u can saw it yourself just speed down nothing can be so perfect u fag..]
 [yo llegó a 2%]
 [HACKED the UFO is to straight]
 [GG I did in 9 attempts]
 [I sometimes use it like that but I have no Idea what else to do. What you're sayin? No, I am not a kid, just wanna be an expert creator!]
 [stupid kid creators used 3d lines to fake the block]
 [Ah, well, yeaah, thet's right XD]
 [SUREEEEE, I totally would believe a person who couldn't spell "awesome" correctly in their username.]
 [+The awsome gamer Are you seriosly that stupid, man? Learn how the game works!]
 [+Cian Dolan Are u retarded? You can make fake blocks in gd. I know that because i'm a creator]
 [Gg]
 [You can make blocks there but can go through them]
 [+Cian Dolan you people know nothing :v]
 [+SonicBoom7293 He's not riot did hack compare it to cyclic cyclics skilled]
 [Yup]
 [+Caden Yost are you joking?]
 [maybe you can try problematic by Dhafin,its a nine circles level. I recently beat it (its my second demon) It can be a bit hard but if you practise enough you can beat it. I beat at after the nightmare (another easy demon) this level fellt way harder but after 1470 attempts I beat it(I know thats much :P)]
 [X by triaxis]
 [+Evil Toad Speed Racer is a fairly easy fun level]
 [Ligtning Road]
 [+Evil Toad the most easy demon i have beaten is called The Nightmare. Probably the easiest demon out there.]
 [Impulse was the first demon I've beaten. It's a pretty easy demon.]
 [ID: 915886  It even has a hidden path at the end with the gravity spike. The only hard part (for me, atleast) is timing the flappy UFO.]
 [+Evil Toad The Lightning Road]
 [+Evil Toad its so cool how the gd community has helped u ive read the comments well some not all way too much and yea good luck on beating more demons :)))]
 [+WarlockDustin' It took me about the same amount of time. I had put like 80 attempts into it before I'd ever legit tried to beat a demon, so when I beat it it was through 53 practice attempts (in which I completed the level 3 times) and then 44 normal mode attempts, for a grand total of 97 :)]
 [+WarlockDustin' Haha no problem :D and in less attempts. You got skills man :D]
 [+Konsta Kovala That sucks. Do you have bad internet or something?]
 [+Konsta Kovala Reanimation? Its way cool. It has an epic boss fight in it.]
 [+Evil Toad now I need to find a demon .]
 [+Evil Toad no , it still demon for me]
 [+Konsta Kovala Oh practice mode became my best friend once I started pursuing demons. Before, I thought practice mode was a waste of time. Boy did I not know how wrong I was until I went after some demons. I'll be sure to give it extra practice then :) Also, if anyone is interested, I actually have a level I'm in the process of verifying that is going to be demon. Its going to be a medium to hard demon. Its going to be called Deep Freeze. I'll probably post about it when I finally do verify it. (Its turning out to be a nightmare to verify, because not only is it difficult, but its over 4 minutes long). If anyone is interested I'd love to have it played when I get it done :)]
 [+Evil Toad you have to practice it to memorise the parts that you know what to do and it has like 2-3 pretty fast skill parts. Good luck!!]
 [I've got 5 now :) I beat yStep most recently. I played one earlier today, and I reached 40% pretty quickly (like 12 attempts lol). Its called Reanimation. Anyone know how hard that one is?]
 [toe 2 is pretty easy i beated it in five months of training and i were a noob, but now im completing hard wave challenges (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [+Evil Toad Hahaha, I had a VERY similar experience when I first joined GD.  I had only beaten up to back on track I think and I ran into Supersonic on the features page.  I thought it was possible for a brief moment but then gave up at like 3%.  Later I found the youtube GD community and realized it was one of the extreme demons lol. (and back then it had just came out and it was considered a lot harder, almost no one had beaten it legit yet)]
 [motion by tama_n]
 [The nightmare is really easy]
 [+Carson Brett (CheezyChez) he beat clusterfuck]
 [Pink]
 [platinum adventure :D]
 [The nightmear and the Lightning road]
 [+Evil Toad the nightmareysteptheory of everything 2]
 [But some easy demons I've beaten are  Lightning road The nightmare Crazy Insomnia X DarnocDynamix Atlas Demon mixed And Xstep v2]
 [100% deadlocked lol]
 [+Evil Toad I needed a fifth Demon and since Demon Mixed only took you 177 attempts, I tried it...it took me 91 and only about 10-15 minutes...thanks for unintentionally leading me to a ridiculously easy Demon!]
 [+Evil Toad  Demon step is a pretty good practice for gravity ball.  I was able to beat it in 40 minutes a few days ago.  It was my 5th demon.]
 [+Joey D 23% Deadlocked]
 [Doing better than me xD.  I only have 18% on deadlocked.]
 [i beat all default levels except for deadlocked._. (deadlocked im like 46%)]
 [+Evil Toad After that, try xStep v2, ClutterStep and DarnocDynamix.]
 [+Mateus Souza Impulse. Got it :) I'll let you know how I do :)]
 [+Evil Toad Now try Impulse.]
 [I've beaten 4 now :D The Nightmare: 335 attempts The Lightning Road: 337 attempts Crescendo: 1006 attempts Demon Mixed: 177 attempts :)﻿]
 [Some of the easier demons would be The Nightmare (it was my first demon) Lightning Road, Super Cycles is semi hard, and Demon Step.]
 [I got a few suggestions: The Lightning Road by Timeless ( if you can't find it go to map packs and go to Demon pack 3), The nightmare by GW Jax, Infinite circles by Startor , and Seeker of Demon by seeker they are the easiest demons I know of, they may take a little over 1000 attempts but their demons what do you expect?]
 [+Geometry Dash Sirius Yes, it is.]
 [CLUBSTEP]
 [Try The lighting road]
 [Try back on track.]
 [The Nightmare is the easiest to me]
 [+Evil Toad The Lightning Road, Demon Mixed and The Nightmare are the easiest DEMONs of Geometry Dash. Also, xStep v2, Impulse and Crescendo are kinda easy.]
 [the lightning road is really easy]
 [Try the Lightning road cause it was the 1st demon I completed]
 [+Evil Toad In my time playing Geometry Dash, I've beaten 16 demon levels, the hardest of which is either Clubstep or -Sirius- by FunnyGame. Some of them are pretty easy, though, like The Lightning Road by Timeless, and GREEN DEMON by Nano4618. I have a playlist on YouTube of all the Demon levels I've played. Check it out if you want some more suggestions.]
 [+BlueAssasinGamerz Intro and more The Updated Cataclysm?]
 [I died in the last ship in cataclysm bcuz of that spike ;-;]
 [+Angga Yudha yeah. I'm like 58% into Problematic :)]
 [+Evil Toad nice! Have you tried problematic? Great level for wave practicing]
 [Thanks for all the suggestions everyone. About 5 minutes ago I completed The Nightmare to earn my first Demon level completion. Thank you for helping me everyone. :)]
 [try xyz step or platinum adventure.]
 [blue hell, problematic and paracosm circles]
 [Try Platinum Adventure.]
 [+Cool Guy txs 4 that i am gonna play it]
 [+Evil Toad The Lightning Road still a demon!]
 [+Luckey GMD platinum adventure is the easiest demon in GD]
 [Don't Forget The Nightmare!]
 [Problematic, The Lightning Road, Ultra Paracosm, Clubstep, yStep, Retro Circles, Horizon, Relativo, Theory of Everything 2, Reanimation, and Death Moon :)]
 [+Evil Toad The nightmare/relativo]
 [+Evil Toad I was once in ur spot... i beat electrodynamix a week ago ;). Try The lightning road]
 [try the lightning road its easy ive not completed electroman adventures yet and i got 88% gl]
 [+GD Camerz except now i beat 21 demons]
 [lol same with me]
 [Try horizon by motu2]
 [+Evil Toad search on yt top 50 easy demon levels]

 [still harder than back on track]
 [Was this meant meant to follow up on cataclysm? The music picks up right where CC ended. And there's the "u need to rest..." bit.]

 [LAL]
 [GhostSkiller and back on track is 2 stars]
 [Azelcanazel Blast processing is 10 stars too and TOE2 is 14 stars lol]

 [RubRub is Rubtarted]
 [RubRub is ReRetarted]
 [no...? Why is that....?]
 [Azelcanazel Beating bloodbath should give like 9999999999 stars and 9999999999 of just everyrhing]
 [11 auto = 1 bb  15 min = haf of ur lyf]
 [Fingerdash - 12 stars Bloodbath - 10 stars Fingrdesh harrder cunfyrmed]
 [Azelcanazel hahah]
 [Bloodbath should be 9999999999999999 stars]
 [Azelcanazel Geometrical Dominator - 10 stars]
 [Azelcanazel XD]
 [How? Bloodbath is significantly harder than Clubstep. If anything, Clubstep is probably one of the easiest demons and Bloodbath is almost the 10th hardest demon in all of GD, but somehow Clubstep is worth more stars.]
 [TheKingT No it makes sense.]
 [Clubstep = 14 Stars Bloodbath = 10 Stars RobTop, go home, your drunk]
 [30 stars]
 [Azelcanazel u mean Blast Proccessing 10 stars bloodbath 10 stars  trust me blast processing is 10 stars]
 [Bloodbath should be 20 or 21 Stars... since it's Extreme Demon.]
 [Jonathan Dong Actually the real star rating does make sense.]
 [Bloodbath=1000000000000000 stars]
 [Mateus Souza but ICDX is harder than Cataclysm on 60hz]
 [Azelcanazel Haha so unoriginal]

 [over 30 people have beaten bloodbath]
 [Ikr it seems so unfair. Riot made an amazing level that like 3 people can beat but its the same stars as xstep]
 [Vaaaaat?]
 [riot I bless you subscribe!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀]
 [Xstep = 2-3 stars you must be garbage.]
 [lol]

 [+Evyatar Keret oh wow lol I didn't know that]
 [+Alexander Xique bruh, im not trying to say riot is better than everyone. but if you think you can create a harder lvl than a lvl who 10 demon creators made, its not gonna be so possible. if you will make ill be glad for ya. but first you should know how to create a harder lvl than weoweoteo, vermillion, michigun, evasium, crack, asonicmen, etzer, havok, giron, gboy. (yeah i know riot built something. he built the GG RIOT at the end)]
 [+Evyatar Keret so your saying that riot is better than everyone? if not then shut up I have a creative mind to continue the level and I believe in myself to beat.

 [+benjamaster7 what do u mean....]
 [+Endrr "find a rhythm"]
 [In his q&a video you will know]
 [+Horror and Halloween 101 its a meme/joke. everyone who plays GD jokes about back on track's difficulty (easiest official level gd in my opinion)]
 [+The Smileyfan Ok, thanks.]
 [+Elijah Mora let me clarify, Zobros was the one who created the joke, he said it first before cyrillic did and it was on a stream I think]
 [+Horror and Halloween 101 I'm pretty sure the joke was started by Cyrillic when he released an impossible level that looks like back on track but it has a lot of invisible objects everywhere making it impossible, or I could be completely wrong, who knows?]
 [Am I the only one who finds sm and poler easier than bot]
 [+EclipZe Gaming FYI it was created by Zobros, and soon ppl kept on using it]
 [Its an overated joke lol]
 [+Horror and Halloween 101 it's cuz bot is so much easier than stereo madness that people saying it was ultra hard as jokes. Then it got mainstream in the gd community and everyone started saying it was impossible. And u beat it...twice?!?!?!? Ur better than riot omg omg OMG]
 [+GD,MC Eko Thank you for explaining that to me. ]
 [It's a joke. lol]
 [+Horror and Halloween 101 Tbh BoT (Back on Track) is the easier than Stereo Madness and most of the levels because it doesn't have triple spikes, therefore doing the opposite of being the easiest and now being the hardest.]
 [+Bionic VorteX I've had the game for well over a year and beaten most of the levels, and Back on Track is by far one of the easiest. ]
 [+Bionic VorteX I just beat it again, it's not hard at all, i'm so confused?]
 [Nobody knows how it started, but people make jokes and say back on track is impossible]
 [back on track is still harder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]

 [this level is actually pretty easy if you break it up into small parts consistency is what makes it so hard]
 [Did you really do all of that. Not possible I don't believe you that you did this. Your a hacker. But if really did this well, then you past. You impressed me so good luck with other demon levels. That level was pretty hard for me but I passed it to so well played and good luck]

 [+llRiotll I'm so proud of you beating BB but CC witch of a madder of course is kind of the EASIER demon version of BB because they are both INSANE demons but I don't get why CC was made first because its kind of like putting an easier version of a not even created level. Some people don't even get this mix up. And a matter of fact... I don't. So is there something I'm not getting or all the people in GD are just mistaken because BB was actually supposed to be a MUCH HARDER demon then CC? I really don't get it at all... Because also Gb0y had the 2nd hardest part in BB or maybe 1st but he was the one who created CC? I'm not getting this at ALL. Its like FNAF all over again (of course I had to do that). But I just HAPPENDLY want to know if BB was a harder version of CC or CC was supposed to be an easier version of BB? Either comment it or don't choose either but then that's when I get into my DUMB zone. Cause then now I'm thinking that CC and BB are 2 TODALY different things. I just don't get it cause CC and BB are most rather A LOT alike! Its like I don't know I cant handle it its just to MUCH! I'm not getting this as a side chain of Riot beating CC then beating ICDX and had an idea to smoosh them together into one of the known HARDEST demons in GD. You asked all of the good creators exept for Zenthic and Vip and wanted them to make parts of BB and then you wanted to get all of those parts and smoosh them together in level editor and randomly be the only one with the shortest part of BB. Witch is of course the beginning witch then ends straight away after you do that wave part with actually spikes that CROSS there normal way they spawn of putting them up one and that's it. I'm thinking you wanted to have the hardest part. Although your part ends up as the 3rd hardest part in BB or maybe even that ship part on ethisium was maybe even HARDER. Well who cares I'm just really confused of this. Its actually quite similar to FNAF so the FNAF 1 that pizzeria ends up as actually the second pizzeria and then the FNAF 2 restaurant ended up as the first restaurant. Just like either CC accidently ended up as coming first. (Glad you read all this skrub I'm proud of u). Just please tell me what's happening. I mean its weird like BB v2 is insane and a HELL lot easier. just like FNAF 3 is easier then actually all the games. IM SO CONFUSED. Please reveal the true story of why this happened. I know everyone who is about to comment is gonna be like "Well you didn't know that CC was actually made before BB just Riot had a LOT longer time!" WELL NO! CC was right verified before BB was completed. I know CC was first not because it was verified first but because it was made first. I am expecting there to be coins to CC and then Riots Randomly GoNnA bEaT iCdX v2 and then he's just DUMB enough to think he can make a BB v2. Your probably gonna get REALLY intimidated into doing it because you're actually just gonna call it BB v2 but then only add coins to it. No change just coins. If I'm not getting this straight then I must be taking this thing WAY to far! I'm sorry if this was a waste of time just because the situation isn't really that big of a deal but it is to ME! Now I know SOMEDAY you will be just eager to make a BB v2 and do exactly what I said "Your not gonna make any changes just add coins". So as always why is this so confusing and why is this such a problem to GD players saying "OMG CC is easier than BB but BB isn't even out!". I'm like that to. I'm VERY eager to know what happened because I personally know that CC is an easier version of BB. Same stuff everywhere. Literally I'm confused.

 [Why are you so sensitive about hearing a tiny thing? You're acting like this is the most important topic happening in 2016. Just calm down man, you don't need to reply to every single comment either lol. And if people can't hear it, just don't be a dick about it and say disrespectful shit. Just bring it down a notch. If you hear it, you heard it. If you can't, you didn't hear it. Simple as that.]
 [+Dave Breslin k. now someone is gona end up hearing a bloody nuke going off... jks]
 [+ScarySpiDer3 all I heard was a door open]

 [Heard a tiny little noise right after he stopped breathing]
 [+Evil 1 why... Why did you insult him for hearing something...]
 [+Evil 1 No he did.... FFs you still trying to prove its wrong by saying shit like santa 420's little children...]
 [+Tman11504 Shut up faggot. You didn't hear shit.]
 [I heard it lol XD]

 [+CrashDemon 53 Me too xD A little noise x)]
 [+ScarySpiDer3 Yes, I heart it, at 3:51 lol :D]
 [+ScarySpiDer3 I hear a tiny little whine straight after his breathing but that's still him though.]
 [+GunnerGames Yea well surprise surprise the only language I do is English so if you try and talk to me in any other way nothing's going to happen.]
 [Dieing reason: Verifier of the worlds hardest level ever beaten breaths too hard to ears. Rip Kappa.]

 [+小火球 Ugh, again, in english please.]
 [+Evil 1 *still struggling to the "truth" that riot's mum didn't say anything because he can't hear it]
 [+ScarySpiDer3 Accept I'm wrong? What a stupid thing to say then calling me a faggot what are you a small child? I can't hear it and you can't blame me because I likely will have better equipment than you anyway.]
 [+Swagnezone thank you]
 [Also I heard something, it was really faint but I think it was riot crying because it sounded like more of a whine than speech]
 [Hahahahaha butthurt people on the internet who can't take opinions and whether their wrong or right         I love it]
 [+Evil 1 Omg ffs just accept ur wrong. You can't take losing an argument. here... listen just after he stops breathing you hear a faint voice say " what's wrong?" but obviously you're going to say never heard it cos ur a fgt. come on man.]
 [+GunnerGames Because it isn't true.]
 [+小火球 Dude that makes no sense. Learn to speak English you stupid Jap.]
 [+ScarySpiDer3 Good make a video then, I'll look forward to seeing it.]

 [+Evil 1 Ill even make a video about it. So stfu you gimp]
 [+Rob Buck I can't hear it either they're talking shit.]

 [Music?]
 [riot is a duck confirmes]
 [That was hacked lol]
 [Silent Acropolis and the other impossible levels aren't legit. This is considered to be the hardest level a human has beaten.]
 [Cuz Silent Acropolis is slow.]
 [+Vince and Shaine Channel Cataclysm is better created tho (my opinion)]
 [Dis. Dis is harder]
 [+Kevin La Cruz true]
 [Beat electrodynamix. It's not hard if you're decent at the game]

 [Back On Track is harder.]
 [+ahmad kumail youre serious? even the lvl im creating and maybe gonna verify soon is harder then that]
 [+Joel Dayola its the hardest possible lvl]
 [+Aero Gg still, it's very difficult.]
 [+ahmad kumail  You must be high. Windy landscape is NOWHERE NEAR the difficulty of this level.]
 [Easy compared to Bloodbath.]
 [Windy landscape?]
 [The hardest level is "The Wall" by Cyrillic :P]
 [Hardest level is bloodbath with one added spike that is impossible to get hit by. One more item makes a difference even though you can't get to it]
 [THE HARDEST IMPOSSIBLE LEVEL IS DEADLY SILENT CLUB RETARDS 😩😩😩😩☝]
 [Legend of Crimson by Faren29 is the hardest impossible level right now. It's official on the GD forums.]
 [+mbiggz gaming silent circles. Bruh]
 [+mbiggz gaming no it isnt, i personally believe silent clubstep is an impossible level that can actually be beaten, if you want most impossible level, any level with mini wave going through a 1 block space for over 1 second]
 [The hardest IMPOSSIBLE level is Silent Clubstep.]
 [+Joel Dayola hardest demon yes hardest level no]
 [I know]
 [+Super Pie Than cataclysm. Not NK. If your confused a littlw]

 [+Michael Malkhasyan that riot thing was joke   Also, I have 68 attempts on tm, and 481 on bloodbath (3%). The world record for bloodbath is 44% by GironDavid. YOU, on the other hand, have no proof whatsoever that you beat bloodbath. Give me some proof and I'll believe you]
 [+Joel Pelayo then u should try it with yours]

 [+Terence Leung Rage much? probs jelous]
 [+Terence Leung Screw off, please.]
 [He verified it you twat. Other people made it too. Go hate on their pages as well.]
 [+Terence Leung and besides, he didnt make it. he only verified it. etzer, michigun, crack, gboy, giron, etc. worked on the whole level. but riot had the toughest job; verifying it. of course he'd be proud.]
 [+Terence Leung Because it is.]
 [Jelly much?]
 [+Terence Leung Um. Did you not read my reply? ]
 [Well, it is the hardest demon verified legit]
 [+Minute Lemons  Please read what Im saying. I did not mean it was not an Extreme Demon, im just saying he decides to show off his, oh, WONDERFUL AND FABULOUS new demon that's the "hardest" demon in the game]
 [+Terence Leung Another minecraft nerd... This is like the 7th trillion person I've responded too. Of course it's Extreme Demon. what is it? Medium demon? Let's see you try it. Oh wait, it's practically impossible for you to beat it in under a year. Also, all of his ( not his but you know what i mean) other Demon levels they he USE to to rate was way to underrated. Qhen in reality, it was a lot harder for other people. So he just made it demon. This level is OBVIOUSLY Extreme. So don't say something you don't know, kid.]
 [+Terence Leung He used to put demon difficulties in his titles but people kept saying he was underrating demons, like when he called windy landscape a medium demon because it was easy to him, so he removed them, the only reason this one says Extreme is because its a giant accomplishment and NO ONE can say its an understatement]
 [+Johnnycraft I mean that all of his demon videos are [DEMON] and just on HIS level that he beat he put (Extreme Demon)]
 [You try to beat it if you think it's not extreme.]
 [And it IS something worth showing off]
 [Well it is an extreme demon]
 [AND it was on his level. Extreme demon bloodbath ohhh look so hard did omg I'm gonna put that yea gonna show off to all the people to show how hard this is woowwwww]
 [This looks easy! *plays it* *beats in 1 attempt* *wakes up * Huh? *checks gdash & plays for real* oh,this is great..]

 [Seee xD]
 [+Geometry Dash Skeleton Okay]
 [+Magnituderna sakupen is harder cuz last dual.]
 [+Spencer Rust​​ BB is harder than Phobos nerfed version. Which is now. If Phobos wasn't nerfed then Phobos would be 2x harder or higher than BB. Though at 92% was literally almost impossible to make without speed hacks. ﻿]
 [BB IS HARDER THAN THAT]
 [+Magnituderna It's possible. It's not impossible. People overrated it too much in my opinion. But the timings are very crucial on the waves and pretty much everything else is easy, if you practice it enough. In my opinion, BloodBath is harder.]
 [+Spencer “El tio Spenza” Rust How is it harder? It's so short. (like my penis xddDDxdxDDXdxdxdxdxDxd ecksde) jk]
 [+Edu Vega  Who are you talking to?]

 [+matterminator57 He says swag its not lag or quack because it doesnt even sound like quack and the way he says it wouldnt be used for lag. And if there was lag he would have died right there because lag on Gd is a death sentence.]

 [You do realize the others used a secret way.  RioT had to do it 100% LEGIT]
 [The later creators probably just used a secret way to save time, while Riot would beat the whole level.]
 [+Emperor Palpatine no, so first weoweoteo beat the first part then vermillion beat the first two parts and so on. GGoy and riot almost beat the same amount due to riot only having a one second part]

 [Mosertron, don't even try. These type of people are so idiotic they bring you down to their IQ level then beat you with experience.]
 [+mosertron bro I'm still here]
 [+Sir Osaid Anyway goodbye. I have now blocked you. And don't even think about coming back to my channel again. Good day. :)]
 [+Sir Osaid It quite literally says "no thank you". Meaning that I did NOT thank you. Were there a comma, "no, thank you" then I would have been thanking you. But what I said means that I am not thanking you.]
 [+Flqmez thanks lol]
 [+mosertron "no thank you" yeah you did bro]
 [+Sir Osaid Ooooo, burn! SAVAGE.]
 [+Sir Osaid That's why I didn't.]
 [+mosertron no need to thank me bro]
 [+Sir Osaid Jealous of what? Your ignorance? No thank you.]
 [+mosertron still jelus bro?]
 [+Sir Osaid No, we're way past you asking which is harder.  And FYI it's Bloodbath, idiot.]
 [+mosertron wow just because I wanna know which is harder u block me. The communitee is messed up]
 [+Sir Osaid That's just because  I haven't figured out how to block you yet. :/]
 [+mosertron bro u been replying for so long u obviously do]
 [+Sir Osaid Whatever, I don't care.]
 [+mosertron but it's not past bedtime]
 [+Sir Osaid Exactly, your mistake was waking up.]
 [+mosertron bro it's 3:32 pm here u ok?]
 [+Sir Osaid Nothing ever changed, dipwad. Now go to bed, it's past your bedtime.]
 [+mosertron now u changing it again bro lol]
 [+Sir Osaid No, you said both meanings applied. I said that I only meant for the second meaning, BUT if you feel like the noun of a troll (first definition) applies to you, then go ahead and accept that title.]
 [+mosertron u deny it first now u say yes to both meanings. Lol u trying to hide ur failure]
 [+Geometry Dash ioprocessing bro just calm down]
 [+ExPwn wow homophobe. I hope u die irl]
 [+Sir Osaid You're frickin' retarded. If a word has multiple definitions then it only takes on ONE meaning when used. But, I suppose both can apply to you if you want.]
 [Guess I can cross 'Getting a troll to admit they were trolling' off my bucket list.]
 [+Sir Osaid ur fucking gay i hope u die]
 [+mosertron yeah so u called me both things cuz it has 2 meanings]
 [+Sir Osaid No. -_-  The SECOND definition says "offensive OR PROVOCATIVE". That has nothing to do with an ugly dwarf.]
 [+mosertron so u call me  a ugly dwarf dude screw u I thot u were cool]
 [+Sir Osaid OR provocative. ;)]
 [+mosertron dude my post wasn't offensive it was a simple question]
 [+Sir Osaid  Troll Definition:  Troll (1):  a mythical, cave-dwelling being depicted in folklore as either a giant or a dwarf, typically having a very ugly appearance.  Troll (2):  make a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them.   So yes, you are technically correct, but I was referring to the other definition.]
 [+mosertron dude trolls are a mythical creature That live under a bridgr]
 [+Sir Osaid That's what trolling is. Pranking or joking to the extent where it ticks people off.]
 [+SuperCanadianMooseRider That comment with that profile picture made me lol.]
 [+mosertron Plz no I was jk bro]
 [+Sir Osaid Aha! Told you you were trolling! Thanks for finally admitting it. :)]
 [+Geometry Dash ioprocessing what the fuck bro it's just a prank calm down]
 [+Sir Osaid  OMFG SHUT UP IF YOU COMPLETED IT UPLOAD A SCREENSHOT AND ELECTRODYNAMIX ISN'T HARDER THAN THIS YOU ARE JUST A FUCKING RETARD WHO WANTS ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING BITCH LIVING IN A HOLE UNDER A ROAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO FUCKING LIFE AND NO PURPOSE ON THIS WORLD TO MAKE PEOPLE FUCKING UPSET BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T BEAT BLOODBATH OR ELECTRODYNAMIX, BECAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING NOOB WHO CAN'T DO SHIT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR WITH NO. FUCKING. LIFE.]
 [+Flqmez I never wanted to prove it 2 anyon I just wanted 2 no whitch is harder and every1 is getting jealous and givign me atention  including u]
 [+Flqmez Thank you. He's been following me around commenting on other videos and it's bugging the crap out of me. He even came to one of MY videos.]
 [+Sir Osaid And you, stupid kid. Should screenshot it. Don't tell people they have no evidence when you don't either. Screenshot or else you're making yourself look stupid. Your grammar is trash, you're Lying is trash, everything you have is trash. So stop fkn Lying or just leave earth, Please.]
 [+Daniela Yordanova He's not trolling tho]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash ok calm down lolol someone's jealous ]
 [Im fucking done with you now.]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash that's only on custom levels]
 [+Sir Osaid search this: Geoemtry dash 2.01 anti cheat   -It's the first vid that shows up]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash show me vid]
 [+mosertron because people say they have and there is proof of waves moving insanely fast and perfectly straight ship parts]
 [+Sir Osaid Nope, I just know cause I saw a video on it while watching videos of people exposing hackers.]
 [+Sir Osaid I know it doesn't to you, read the first sentence I said again.  If you are to claim that the only reason he knows that hacks don't work anymore is because he tried it, then the same logic can be applied to you. How do you even know that you can hack Geometry Dash? Because you've done it?]
 [+mosertron lol that makes no sense]
 [+Sir Osaid Dude, you are freakin' retarded. I assume the only reason you know that hacking even exists is from experience? Moron...]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash do u no this from experience? hacker.]
 [+Sir Osaid nope, if it detects you hacking a level it kicks u out of the level]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash robtop made it harder 2 hac but not imposible.]
 [hacking was disabled in 2.0.1]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash u r hack? ship part is too smooth]
 [Its up on youtube now]
 [+Sir Osaid This trolling is too great! XD]
 [K one sec]
 [+XxPatrickxX Geometry Dash yeah right record it then]

 [+GD Bmm404040 So is Sir Osaid saying that he is even than Zobros, Cyclic, Michigun, Riot and some other pro players there? I mean its impossible to finish that in 300 attempts. Even Zobros will get 300 attempts at around 20% in practice.]
 [+ALEJOR 7 plz tell me that was sarcasm?]

 [So a blue remake of this level would probably be called waterbath, a green version maybe toxic bath/nature bath. White version would be milkbath or milkybath, not sure about purple, but a yellow one would be peebath xD, brown one chocolate bath or poobath, black one would be oilbath/coca colabath. Rainbow = MLGbath.]

 [Song name till minute 1:45? (Please don't say Darude- Sandstorm or something like that)]
 [what is riot's texture pack]
 [When you create a level you have to beat it and it depends on what you're skill level is]
 [I can never bet]
 [He needs to verify the level before he published it.  You need to complete the level to verify the level to see if it is possible.]
 [ᕦ( ͡°╭͜ʖ╮ ͡°)ᕥ]
 [Look who it is.]
 [jajajaj lol]
 [+leonardo trulli theoretically]
 [+hacker pro its the hardest level in geometry dash verified legit]
 [+leonardo trulli silent circles is possible. satans circles and stuff like that is not, because one space ufo.]
 [yes it is true]
 [Actually it would require a speed hack because 1. A wave cannot move that fast normally. 2. If used a glitch to verify it, means the creator himself admits that it is impossible]
 [+leonardo trulli they are not impossible, just exrtemely hard. there no wall or anything at the end.]
 [+leonardo trulli hardest is like silent wave or final silent]
 [+Geometrical Dash not even close bruh]
 [+Zundex12 Te encontré :v, ahora pasalo :v]
 [bloodbath is way harder compared to fairydust lol]
 [+Brian H thx]
 [+Vic[e] impressive]
 [+yellow the fellow wow thx. i beat it in 1882 attempts]

 [cyka pidar blyat, idi nahui ruski]
 [+u wot lel im just tired of peoples shit, (tbh i am a fanboy)]
 ['You should be happy riot got 1 mil views and 60k subs. fucking pitiful. im done. cyclic fanboys will never in a 1000 years get over that riot became the best"  coming from the riot fanboy 8^)]
 [+benjamaster7 you know when you see a fanboy when he sees someone over take there "god" in almost every way and complain about it -_-. Jesus christ bro, i have seen you many times in the comments praising cyclic like he is your god. Just get over that cyclic isn't the best anymore. You should be happy riot got 1 mil views and 60k subs. fucking pitiful. im done. cyclic fanboys will never in a 1000 years get over that riot became the best. You are so blind.]
 [+benjamaster7 1. I don't think riot is misleading us 2. I think cyclic and riot are level in skill tbh]
 [+TheTrueAndOnlyOne GeometryDash hasn't the best player... cyclic is twice as good as him but Riot is just misleading because he uploads every hard demon he beats. Cyclic also can't be recognized theses days because his channel got deleted.]
 [+benjamaster7 Riot is the best player, its just that he doesnt give a shit about the stars, Stars = Higher on the leader board]
 [+u wot it makes me so sad that it got 1m views... This one million people who saw it will be fooled to think that bloodbath is hardest demon ever rated and that riot is the best player ever.]
 [Yes thats the point of this video!!!! :D]

 [Good thing you didn't click the level editor button after you completed it! 7:01, did anyone see bloodbath II? (2)]
 [riot is dead]
 [3:41 Climax XD]
 [My mom walked in just when you made those noises after finishing the level. I didn't had headphones on....]
 [I once saw a comment on Bloodbath saying: Gg easy your a bad player riot. I'm so glad it was gone]
 [Riot the best in the world :)]
 [U r a fckng beast]
 [OMFG riot is fuckin good player]
 [1 MILLION IS COMING OH YEA ITS JOHN CENA nah jk Iam serious 1 mill is coming]
 [Took me about 1,500 attempts for practice mode. This level is truly insane]
 [Good Job RIOT ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [Is bloodbath harder than the ultimate phase?]
 [lol it would be easier if you just added a super secret way °( ͜ʖ ͡)°]
 [Me hice el doble de intentos en clubstep mejor no pruebo tu nivel GG grande riot]
 [The one main reason that I do not plan on attempting this level any time soon, is because I know that I would die at the triple spike at the end..]
 [All that's left is for someone to make a level that can be abbreviated as "AA," and use the last part of this song! Then we'll have: CC, BB, and AA.]
 [best attack]
 [he beat it in the video on his 34th tries it took me that amount of tries to beat deadlocked]
 [I can't believe im saying this but I want bb v2. like if you want it too!]
 [03:44 ( ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡° )]

 [Noone other can beat this level EVER]

 [it was a joke xD]
 [I beat that like in 30 attempts. ]
 [+Minute Lemons "The Lightning Road"]
 [+Cool Dash Not really. I don't like grinding demons like some people. I just played a random demon and Got around 68% in like 300 attempts. I forgot what it was called though]
 [+benjamaster7 He is right. Most 2.0 levels nowadays have the suckiest gameplay, and in a lot of cases it would take me less time to beat five 1.7 demons then one 2.0 7 star level.]
 [+Minute Lemons LOL you know its true]
 [+benjamaster7 ugh. Do I have to explain? This is like the 50th comment of yours that your wrong.  ]
 [+Ethan Hansen dood, nobody can beat a 2.0 7 star level. Not even Riot.]
 [+benjamaster7 Cyclic took a break from gd because he had exams. He lost some of s skill, as when he came back, he said that he couldn't complete a 7 star 2.0 level. Now it flipped, riot quit and cyclic is back, so cyclic will reclaim the throne soon.]
 [+Cool Dash ey cool sash its demented turtle from the wikia :P]
 [I am above him on the leader board and I don't hack ;3;]
 [+Ethan Hansen you cant say cyclic isnt good anymore. Give me proof he isnt good anymore.]
 [+benjamaster7 Riot is better than cyclic until cyclic gets back on his A game since riot quit.]
 [+Minute Lemons EXAGGERATION]
 [+benjamaster7 cyclic isn't 10x better than Riot. Man, this is like the 20th comment of  yours that your wrong]
 [+MJyoshi its quite sad.]
 [sad i like riot and AdvyStyles the most]
 [+MJyoshi ._. Cyclic is 10x better than this guy but Riot got all the credit because his video went viral. Cyclic deleted his channel because of school ;~;  So is life.]
 [+DolphinTheLennyiest TheLennyiestOfAllLennys Here I'm on mobile ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]

 [+Minute Lemons I, as a 12 year old, would never even think to say something this dumb or self-centered. You may be looking for, '8 year old'.]
 [This is definitely a 12 year old. Don't even say "I'm 18" because NO adults say that on YouTube.]

 [+Austin Ross oh i did the same thing, thats really sad]
 [+RSJBKMA is that why I can't find bb to play? I searched it but nothing came up]

 [+Game Striker No such thing as level copyright unless its the exact same.]
 [CataclysmicBath has been completed.... Holy shit..... Now I need to verify it, I've tested everything using start pos... It's all humanly possible, It's a bit easier than Cataclysm, but harder than Windy Landscape. I'll start trying to verify it later today, I need a nap...]
 [ApocAlypse]
 [the level name should be AA, cataclysm is CC, Bloodbath is BB, so ya]
 [+TheMadMurdurBlend I'm not even halfway finished with it.]
 [+TheMadMurdurBlend Um, I'm not lying, I've been working on cataclysmic bath for almost 2 weeks, what the hell are you talking about?]
 [He's lying about BB.]
 [+Game Striker Make it a megacollab cuzynot]
 [+baconator burger Yeah, the video is going up later today. So be ready, I'm still editing, I just hope the footage doesn't mess up.]
 [I don't think there is copyright. You can go ahead and do it. just make the level original. ya know..no copy paste stuff. good luck. Also, can't wait for the BB video tomorrow. or today rather]
 [He did xD]
 [Your mom]
 [I'm close to his speed. I can pass all the straight ship parts (I got to them in practice mode)]

 [+Geometry Dash DogGoesWoof It's a troll -_-]
 [it's not even been a year since it was uploaded]
 [This comment was in November 2015. The level was verified in August 2015. No, I don't think anyone should believe you.]
 [Huge lier]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming idk that's kind of a reach XD]
 [how do you know hes probably some dumb idiot who thinks bloodbath has been out for a year who has never played g dash ever so he thinks it out for a year]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming because it's impossible for someone to have taken a year to beat a level that's only been out for a few months, therefore he was just trolling.]
 [+TheMadMurdurBlend didn't feel like replying to everyone. plus everyone who didn't get the joke will see it anyway.]
 [How do you know fuckass?]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming that's the joke dumbass -_-]
 [+Abel Barajas Uh oh, retard alert! *RETARD ALERT, CLASS!*   So let me guess, you also beat Cataclysm, Windy Landscape, ICDX, Acropolis, Hell Factory, Nine Circles, and Silent Deadly Clubstep on your first try, right? Get the fuck out of here. Lying piece of shit.]
 [Damn u so gud tech me to git gud \ ( ͡°◡ ͡° )/]
 [+Abel Barajas lmao you fucks thats the joke he was making.]
 [The level is only 3 months old dumbass... I was in the livestream when he beat it.]
 [Abel fuck off you little asshat, the level came out in August it is November, so go fuck yourself, if you beat it you have hacks]
 [+Abel Barajas Oh yeah... I belive you so hard... BloodBath was released 1 year ago -_-... Yes... You're right...]
 [Yes it is Stupid so shut up]
 [Hasn't even been out for a year retard -_-]

 [Try Back on Track]
 [I'm making this comment for Riot and anyone else who can't complete levels that others canTurn off VSync, sounds stupid, but for me it works, like LightWave, I can't get past it with VSync on, if it's off I can, so yeah]

 [3:20 360 Ufo. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [Only Bloodbath and The Ultimate Phase more hard demon]

 [cual es el nombre de la cancion despues de que lo verifica]
 [I think no one have completed bloodbath yet only riot can do it]
 [I'm sorry but you put a lot of efforts... for nothing. Maybe it's just me but nobody will beat bloodbath (i don't count you or Sung-Su-Kim) or you wanted to release the hardest demon ever. In my opinion releaseing unbeatable demons is worthless wasting of time. Demons should be hard but not too much. Don't make second Silent Clubstep or Sakupen Hell]
 [The legend will be remembered. :o]
 [That Heavy Breathing Scared Me lol]
 [After cataclsym]
 [how to make this map? that is hax]
 [A este chaval se le salio el corazon!!!! LOOOOL]
 [I had the same reaction when I got 5%]

 [+ReedDaBoss12 There's a link on the very bottom on the description that sends you to a picture. This is the link. https://gyazo.com/286811b56c6838532d5...]
 [What picture?]
 [+Sam / Deoxy i made this picture myself for him, and I comfirm.... It is "Flawless wings of Yatasomething"]
 [didn't read the older comments, but i'm pretty sure either riot will make a demon with that song or that he will beat hell factory or both]
 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm Pretty obvious. Hell Factory.  The bird is a yatagarasu. The plane means wings. Flawless Wings of Yatagarasu The song in Hell Factory.         Or the triple trial. Pretty much the same difficulty ;-;   EDIT: He was playing hell factory on stream at one point too. Confirmed???]
 [+Clement Liu (hawkfire7) Are you dumb? It's not a 2.1 sneak peek, it's a sneak peek of the next extreme demon.]
 [+Sam / Deoxy I will believe you because i search in Google Yatagarasu and i found a bird with that 3rd thing...]
 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm Most likely flawless wings of yatagarasu will be the 2.1 song, as well as some rather satanic themes added to GD]
 [+EPICGUYDUDE at the end of the description click the gyazo link]
 [Where? I don't see anything in the video description]
 [+Gmd MalZir YES!!!!]
 [+Gmd MalZir finally a smart one]
 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm 100%=Flawless Airplane=Wings of Monster=Yatagarasu=Flawless wings of yatagarasu]
 [Nothing is confirmed yet, and why would a bird have a claw in their stomach?]
 [+boffis123 that's it's claw.]
 [Then explain to me why there is a P nis on the bird then...]
 [+boffis123 to trick us. Don't question the confirmed.]
 [1st. Why would he have a plane ol the picture if it dosent bean anything?  2nd. If thats not a hand on the bird, then what is it? a P*nis?  3rd. I dont have anything 3rd to say.  4th. Not 4th either.]
 [Guys, I previously told you. This is confirmed by Riot. I talked to him about this. This is the level he is making with Flawless Wings of Yaragaratsu.  100% = Flawless Wings = The Bird He told us the plane means nothing.   This is confirmed.]
 [Plane = F777 (even if thats not a Boeing 777.) Then you see that bird with a hand, let me think of a bird hmm... Oh I know! FALCON! and he is punching something. Falcon punch! Probably a new lvl with F777 falcon punch as song. :)]
 [+Gen R  you can edit descriptions, and that was a dumb question]
 [what the hell, whatever it is I cant wait]
 [I don't see it]
 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm Infernal Abyss? By Gboy?]
 [It's the WIP picture of the demon Flawless Wings of Yatagarasu he is making.]

 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm I have :L]
 [hi.]
 [+Geometry Dash Sandstorm huh just saw it. weir]
 [oh i just saw the pic... 100%, an airplane, a bird.... wut+da+fuk]

 [+Game Striker gods blessings will be with you. Always. i hope you dont spill out all your blood and fuckin...idk...become dehydrated from cryong]

 [i have 45 demon and i beat bb and cataclysm...]
 [+Game Striker you're still lying, no way a random guy with 21 demons could get 49% on cataclysm and 28 on bloodbath wtf]
 [+XxGoldPlayzxX If we're here, then we watch Riot.]
 [+Game Striker GJ Mate]
 [Madmurder, (sorry on mobile so can't +) his not an attention hog he lied for the lolz, and nobody here hates him.]
 [+Game Striker You get a cookie from me for tricking the stupid x'D]
 [?]
 [100% - 00 means 1% forr those who dont know]
 [No, because if they did, they would put it on YT, and only autos happened to be on YT]
 [i did 100% - 00 on bb :3 u got it??]
 [+rudolfs terauds Meh! 47k att :3 My 100th demon :D!]
 [Im do legit :)]
 [+Tao Nope, unless you hacked.   :/ ]
 [+TBGeo 123 i beat bb with 30k att .]
 [+Magdalena Bamaca its easy for tou because riot pass it]
 [+Magdalena Bamaca suurreeee]
 [no too hard]
 [+rudolfs terauds I gues If cyclic were still playing he would have beaten it so easily :p]
 [These comments doe....]
 [nope]
 [+Miles Edgeworth But polargiest is easy wait what.]
 [+rudolfs terauds watch the video]
 [+SethlanMC He admitted it m8. Nobody hates him.]
 [+Game Striker Why the fuck you lying...]
 [cc 12% bb 7%]
 [+rudolfs terauds me 1%]
 [+mrzcarbonz You really don't know, do you? Today people have become VERY VERY Untrusting of others. I'd bet if I said I beat Polargeist you wouldn't believe me either.]
 [+Game Striker I just read this whole conversation lmao like 'people actually believe this?' You are the comment section troll I've ever seen lol.]
 [i definitely didn't fall for this. i knew he was lying from the start.]
 [+rudolfs terauds  I did.]
 [+Brian “Cobalt” H who fell for it?]
 [WOW. gg. great lying skills, you had me fooled.]
 [+Game Striker And miles edgeworth called everybody a dumbass]
 [+Game Striker thank you for telling the truth, I didn't fall for it :p]
 [And I meant 28% on bb, not 38]
 [I'm practicing cataclysm though, I have 49% in 27k attempts.]
 [+bolt853 Well I probably could do bb, the only problem is school and stuff gets in the way and it'd take me over a 100k attempts to beat it.]
 [+Game Striker I figured from the beginning. Lol people who fell for it must be gullible af. I only got 2%. LOL]
 [And, I only have 21 demons complete. The hardest Demon I've done is Windy Landscape. Which took like 15,474 attempts.]
 [Yeah I was actually lying, don't lie you guys know you fell for it. lol. However my real high score is 38% and I really do have like 34k attempts. ]
 [+Game Striker A video uploading doesn't take a damn hour. I didn't believe you from the beginning. Even your comments prove you're lying.]
 [Been playing GD this whole time.]
 [I'm ready.]
 [give it time, it'll be there.]
 [+Game Striker Shortly? been half an hour and still nothing.]
 [I finished Editing it!!! Video is being uploaded now! Should be up shortly!!!]
 [+Game Striker is it done?]
 [I'm too hyped, are you done yet?]
 [HYPE!]
 [+Miles Edgeworth No, just adding the finishing touches]
 [IS IT UPLOADING NOW??]
 [Hype!!!]
 [Almost finished with the editing, video should be up in about an hour or 2!!!]
 [+Game Striker i cheer on you :D pd you have skype?]
 [+Game Striker you said that it was going to be up like 5 hours ago]
 [+bolt853 THE VIDEO IS GOING UP LATER TODAY DAMMIT! I'm still editing it! I'm putting a lot of time into this video!!!]
 [+Game Striker THEN UPLOAD IT DAMMIT! If you don't then no one will believe you!]
 [As I said yesterday, i estimate around 60% of the people who watch my video, will call hacks just because they think Nobody can complete it except for some of the top GD players. Like Riot, Cyclic, Michigun, Zobros, Creepy dash, or AlexPain24]
 [+bolt853 you didn't read the rest of my messages, i said, IN TOTAL I HAD LIKE 33,000 ATTEMPTS, NOW I'M AT 34,000. Video is going up later today btw, so be ready]
 [+Game Striker Do you really think we believe you? How can someone beat bloodbath in 123 attempts?]
 [+Miles Edgeworth Oh I mean 2.01 lol]
 [What about 2.01?]
 [+Miles Edgeworth Yes, 1.01, it's a bugfix update]
 [+Game Striker What version are you using?]
 [1.01?]
 [+Miles Edgeworth Some people still can hack in 1.01 and some haven't even updated]
 [WAIT, RUBRUB MADE AN ANTI-CHEAT FOR GEOMETRY DASH NOW! NOBODY CAN HACK IT ANYMORE, NOT EVEN NOOBAS!]
 [We'll see.]
 [+Miles Edgeworth Yes it would be]
 [Nope.]
 [+Miles Edgeworth ''You guys are jerks'' no actually, I don't think you've been in this community long enough to know that he's lying, because bloodbath is the hardest demon. Also, he has uploaded no GD videos, and wouldn't it be suspicious if his first video was Bloodbath?]
 [Still hasn't uploaded]
 [+Game Striker okay waiting for the gameplay ;D]
 [As I said the video is coming tomorrow, so be patient.]
 [As I said let's see]
 [+Game Striker Liez i dunt believe u]
 [+Miles Edgeworth That's kinda where I'm heading with the idea. ]
 [Sounds like this video actually.]
 [It'll be kinda like a mini montage before the grand finale, plus my orgasmic reaction to beating it while recording. ;)]
 [I believe you m8.]
 [You guys will be saying that when you see my channel tomorrow, think I'm lying. Go ahead. You'll see, all of you will. I can go ahead and estimate real quick, over 50% of the people who see my video will be dumbasses or trolls and call Hacks. The reason the video isn't going up til tomorrow, is due to the fact, I'm editing in a bunch of my derp moments, close attempts, epic saves, and funny fails, that I had when I was recording. The footage of my attempts. The video will be up tomorrow if you guys are interested.]
 [+Ludo Clement +Cobalt Geometry Dash You guys are jerks.]
 [YEAH!]
 [+Game Striker let's see]
 [+Game Striker sure]
 [+Game Striker Lol nice joke]
 [I DID IT!!! I FINISHED IT WHILE RECORDING!!! HOLY SHIT, I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST PERSON COMPLETING IT LEGIT ON YOUTUBE!!! I GOTTA EDIT THE VIDEO, IT'LL BE UP TOMORROW I PROMISE!!!! OMG, I'M GONNA BE IN THE TOP TEN BEST GD PLAYERS!!!! HOLY SHIT, I'VE BEEN PRACTICING THIS FOR LIKE A MONTH, AND I FINALLY DID IT WHILE RECORDING!!! :D]
 [2:29 Also, quack.]
 [+Game Striker Kay.]
 [+Miles Edgeworth I got upset so I took a break, I'm working back on it now.]
 [Video or it didn't happen]
 [+Game Striker Have you beaten it yet?]
 [Blue_ true TRUE on the fourth]
 [+Geometry dash Range beated bb in 2k attempts.  say he beat TUP With the same attempts.  prove it to me.  prove US That you can beat BB And Silent clubstep and TUP  in a video.  otherwise, you are lying more than a snake.]
 [O rly?]
 [Riot must beat "The Wall"]
 [:V]
 [jarvey i challage u to complete the ultimate phase i complete the ulitamate phase with 2k attempts]
 [+Geometry dash Range Shut up you're the noob.]
 [LOL]
 [Bloodbath is harder than EVERY OTHER LEVEL IN GEOMETRY DASH]
 [+BlueStone is silent clubstep possible?]
 [lel i know Riot noob just hack he know xD]
 [+Geometry dash Range riot can finish a copy]
 [Nuuuuu]
 [i cant even find it but im gona be honest i would get 0.1%...also yeah its harder then cc and easier then sc and the glitchy trail/glitchy orbs happened to me a lot]
 [+Geometry dash Range nope it didnt dude its impossible, likle littrly its an impossible level]
 [+BlueStone silent clubstep easy i took just 2k attempt to complete it]
 [but its easier than ur mom! okno fprget about that thats stupid humor]
 [Agreed!]
 [BB is harder the cataclysm... Stereo demoness is not the third hardest demon, its most likely ICDX. UltraSonic is not HARDER ultrasonic is easy compared to these lvls.. :/ and Cataclysm isnt harder cause it has tighter spaces... Like wtf? And riot beat Cataclysm and got WAY better at the game and BB is about twice the difficulty. :3 btw silent clubstep is not possible, and not even demon rating if u guys were just talking about demons. i also checked and it wasnt updated, remember its by Sailent not the first one you see. Lel Also BB is extralong and cataclysm isnt lel]
 [This argument lasted for a month, holy shit.]
 [7. I'm not even that pro lel]
 [+Derek Conway 6: No, you're not making part three. xD]
 [+BlueStone 5. Yes, this is cataclysm part 2.]
 [LOL]
 [+BlueStone ayy LMAO   ~ OpieOP ~]
 [+BlueStone  fuck u]
2 [+ZODgAmInG where the fuck does that get you in this argument?]
 [+Jaden Frampton bloodbath is way harder than cataclysm]
 [+ZODgAmInG 1. I'm trying to 2: No 3. It's literately impossible.]
 [+ExPwn I've played both many times, and I got many expert opinions.]
 [how do u know its harder than cataclysm]
 [+BlueStone Meh, as I said belive watcha want.]
 [Wow I totally believe you now.]
 [+BlueStone Well.. I am a noob. Dafuq do you want from me? Belive wathca want not everybody is a pro.]
 [+FcGod You expect me to believe you? 58k attempts is completely fake for cataclysm. It's hard but it's not that hard.]
 [+BlueStone what if I told you.. I acctualy beat it.. 47k att ;-; but this was my 100 demon I waited few months for bb to be done by riot so It can be my 100 demon.. 50 demon cataclysm (not really but somewhere there) 58k att... Now my ship is straigher them a motherfucking ship on blocks.]
 [In my opinion, the hardest demon is Windlandscope!]
 [+Geometry Dash Rockstr99 go beat riot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
 [Find my if was lv1 of impossible levels "YusuffGDPE" GD ACCOUNT :v]
 [That's okay :3]
 [+BlueStone Oh ok. I'm a little un-updated.]
 [no, the WR is 6%   (By Zobros)]
 [+Lelouch ViBritannia kek silent clubsteps WR is 4%, this level has atleast been completed]
 [Good luck with that.]
 [+Chung do im remaking all the silent levels if was lv1.]
 [All silent levels are impossible duhhh]
 [m8 blue rock this is the seventh time Ive seen you in the comments of videos]
 [+Realizim Hunting i think bb is harder too. But in fact you can proove things to be harder as a fact, like stereo madness to bb. Bloodbath has 1 space to fly in, sm has 6-9 spaces of free flying, so facts llike that can proove things to actually be as a fact harder. i just wanted to say :). btw i agree, dont listen to anyone else on your opinion. Bb can be much harder, but only of its an opinion. :_:]
 [Jaden we tried to save u a facepalm but ur fu***** retarded]
 [Sailent Clubstep has published ID:14087026 rate 2 stars and support with a like :) its the most easy version of the impossible demon called  "Silent Clubstep"]
 [c:]
 [+BlueStone I remember you!]
 [Cataclysm is harder than icdx.]
 [+Farid Abraham it is harder in my opinion]
 [+Farid Abraham CC is so short.]
 [+BlueStone Maybe not harder than Cataclysm but it is longer than CC...]
 [Thanks :3]
 [Red world is easily possible without the invis platforms that shouldn't be there.]
 [Sailent and cyrilic was so crazy (dismute fo ma pefakt german)]
 [+Theblockyhero kuso it is possible ( like TPE @ tm Yustuff whatever!) said, its just so hard, but levels that are REALLY impossible for a human to beat are SlaughterHouse, Silent Circles, ect. but with a computer continulessly activating and deactivating the jump switch, they are "possible" but not that a human can possibly do. The only REAL impossible level( unless you hack to make it impossible to crash in the game or die ), that i know, is Red World.]
 [+Theblockyhero kuso is posible see Zobros vid,he pass it with practice mode,without hacks you have 1% probabilities of pass (Dislike for ma hinglish)]
 [silent clubstep isn't possible]
 [what the hell "Jaden Fampton" or whatever. R u serious.ur one of those guys with too high puberty who thinks hes the best.: Hardest demons 1.BLOODBATH 2.CATACLYSM(NOT HARDER THAN BB DAMMIT) ... 20.SUPERSONIC  WTF]
 [+BlueStone  is it harder than cataclysm??? is it easier than silent clubstep??? do the glitchy trails mean hacks??? did i beat it?????]
 [To some extent it is, barely.]
 [+BlueStone you cannot say its easier than silent clubstep because its impossible, how can it be harder than a level if its not possible (to be hard, it needs to be possible)]
 [Omg I got 11% in blood bath it only took me a day to do]
 [......I already know....?]
 [+BlueStone Sailent's levels were hacked]
 [Geometry Dash commenter. Idiot.]
 [wow.]
 [+BlueStone Yeah, check it out.]
 [Rly?]
 [+BlueStone They updated Silent Club, it's ez af now.]
 [+BlueStone no its wayy harder than Silent Clubstep but not nearly as hard as Back On Track]
 [yeah.]
 [+Game Striker BloodBath you mean?]
 [Actually yes I did, twice actually. it took me 33,342 attempts the first time, but I wasn't signed in so I had to beat it again, and It took another 478 attempts, so now I have 33,820 attempts in total. Though the sad part is, I have no way to prove it. :(]

 [I just realized something... If the whole point of Bloodbath is for it to be almost impossible, then why spend almost two months working on design elements and verifying the level it's self if no one's gonna beat it for like a year or so? Maybe that's the whole point...]
 [RioT and Cyclic are actually the only people that have a chance to beat this...ok, only RioT, Cyclic quit :(]
 [Riot thx for verifying bloodbath 3 days before I was 9 Thx you and god]

 [alright then]
 [+Clement Liu Good, but I don't know it isn't hacked. ]
 [http://prntscr.com/93jbtp There it is :D]
 [I look forward to seeing it. If you really want to impress everyone get 36% and get onto the official records list. ]
 [ok]
 [+Clement Liu How about you upload a mere 30% video. If you got 55, you should have no problem with that. Or, more likely, are you just an attention seeking achievement whore who likes to bullshit about their accomplishments to make their pathetic existence seem justifiable.  Prove me wrong.]
 [kden tommy feel free to be doubtful]
 [+Clement Liu (hawkfire7) There isn't any, so I don't believe it. Neither do I believe you.  Why would you not upload that? You'd become instantly famous.﻿]
 [well wheres official evidence that creep has official WR of 38%]
 [+Joffski Smith well who knows, maybe he does have that much. i mean the level has been out for 2-3 months, its more then possible to get that far. Or maybe hes lying, who knows :P]

 [lol gg, unofficial records op]

 [Nope, dumb joke.]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming Ask anyone who is knowledgeable of the game like me and they will tell you Silent Clubstep is about 15-20 times harder then any level ever beaten legitimently]
 [ Silent Clubstep is literally impossible, therefore it's harder.]
 [It's my opinion asshat]
 [Then you're an idiot. Nuff said.]
 [No I'm not joking]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming You're joking.... right...?]
 [Nope bloodbath is the hardest. Silent Clubstep is just a bit less harder]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming uh, nope... Silent Club is waaaaay harder]
 [Bloodbath is harder boy]

 [Wow what a bunch of fools in this comment section, who cares if he hacked this level or not, all of yous are wasting your lives arguing the point of if he hacked or not, this is a game, it isn't a matter of life and death and soo many people here treat it like it is. Calm the hell down people it's just a video of him beating a hard level, even if it truly is hacked who cares the gameplay still looks impossible which makes you shocked to see it beat with or without hacks, so if you want to say it's hacked you really should save your energy because Riot doesn't give anyways.]
 [What happens when you combine cataclysm and bloodbath into one level.  Oh no!!! Who will survive that??!! AlexPain? Riot? Zobros? Michigun? Gboy? Etzer? ... Who? LOL XD :D]

 [No, you didn't, 9-year old. No one believes you, why you, kids still trying?]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF I argee with most of your points, but saying the *if* he hacked doesn't matter is very wrong.So many people have worked together to build this extra-long level, many people have been streaming Riot trying to verify this in MONTHS, and if he hacked, then everyone would lose faith in Riot, the very best player in GD, in my opinion. But yes, saying he hacked without proof is pretty damm stupid :3]
 [we're all wasting our time because we're replying to this comment :0]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF ur the one who wasted ur time , since he streamed this...]
 [+Geometry Dash NeoNCreePer it's not speed of light]
 [+Blazet 25 It's "Wrote" becouse he already did it.]
 [+Timeless x1000 *Write]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF I love you for posting this comment.]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF Did you wrote the whole bible? lol xD]
 [im finnish!! cmon i have bad english! (if you mean that)]
 [+Geometry Dash NeoNCreePer Um sorry but I cannot argue with someone who refuses to make sense...]
 [+TurboSauce [GD] Speed of Light]
 [if you are wasting your life to write that comment]
 [Anyone know the song used at 0:00 - 1:45?]
 [+Khoi Pham And that is why I commented about them...]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF All of the comments are at the bottom due to dislikes. So I didn't see any. But those people are pretty stupid.]
 [+Khoi Pham Are you sure about that? Lunar said he hacked in the comments and a bunch of other people can you read or no?]
 [No one has said he hacked....]
 [Um you don't understand, I meant people should not waste their times commenting about the person hacking and getting mad at them, do I sound mad to you? And I am not even commenting about riot being a hacker...]
 [I understand that, but you said that there is no reason to comment it and you are right, so you shouldn't comment about it.]
 [+TGI {Zombies/COD} So what? There is that much to say about these people.]
 [You literally just typed three long comments about people getting mad.]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF And this is just a game, everybody is taking it way too seriously. Aren't you suppose to have fun in this game not arguing who hacks and who doesn't? Let hackers be, they purchased this game so they can do as they want with it, it's just like hackers in any other game, you cannot get rid of hackers so if you see a Geometry Dash video that is hacked just ignore it, yous are all wasting your time commenting about it because the hacker really wouldn't care but none of yous know how to ignore...]
 [+Geometry Dash ChaozAF Also I don't think Riot did hack this and here is my reason: If you want to hack a Geometry dash level and put it on a stream he would have to record the speed hacked version of it (the slow motion gameplay) then he would have to speed it up and then he would have to record every part in the video to make it look like it is actually real and then he would stream the recording of the hacked gameplay that is sped up, and the orbs wouldn't move in parts of the level anyways if it really was hacked because the level would loose it's sync. So instead of going through all this video editing stuff he could just beat it legit like he did, by the time he is done patching all the hacked content in the hacked gameplay he would of finished this legit by now. I would rather beat this legit then do that, and it isn't hard to spot if someone is hacking. I mean I am not going to lie I find his trail a bit questionable but I really don't care anyways just leave Riot alone all he is doing is uploading videos, if you do not like it then you can go away and stop bothering people, thanks.]
 [Bloodbath is Easier than Bloodbath...]

 [+Luke Hu Yea Alex isnt the best player in gd but if he wants to beat a map He Beats The fuck Out of it xD even if it takes 4K attempts xDD]
 [+Ryder Hurd Best players are: RioT Cyclic (ded nao) GironDavid Sandstorm Zobros Creepy Dash Powerbomb (ded nao)  Not in a specific order, but Cyclic and RioT are best :)  AleXPain24 is nowhere near, his only insane demons are Supersonic and Windy Landscape.  If you find any that are better than the above, GG.]

 [como se llama la cancion?]
 [Hyperventilating]
 [GG Riot]
 [BLOODBATH NOT DEMON ANYMORE!!!]
 [Is cathaclysm harder then your level?]
 [Wow este tio es un maquina :D]
 [oh wow riot you did so much in this map you did from 3:40 to 3:41        ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ raise your dongers ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ]
 [Wtf you did in this level? Put a little obstacle in the final time (3:40-3:41) Yes,i respect you riot doing this level, HARDEST. But,you didnt do a fuck in this level creating it xD]
 [The Bloodbath Challenge  Every 10 attempts you die on bloodbath (Non-Practice), you pinch yourself, each in a different spot. When you get to 100 attempts and haven't passed 30%, you add another pinch every 10 attempts you die. So, 100-199 attempts would be 2 pinches, 200-299, 4 pinches and so on. Start at your hands and gradually continue upwards, pinch hard but not too hard, or there will be a Bloodbath.  Good luck, and don't hurt yourself too much, remember that this is just a game and you can stop the challenge any time you want.]

 [MOTHER OF GOD... I like how the song starts where cataclysm left off. If only someone combined the two. Might make a difficult little level]

 [+Danyerz dude, half of those levels are impossible with speed hacks even if it was slowed down to 0.000000000000000000000000001 of the speed... the creators just made a hack that let them upload it without beating it or made a hack that starts them upside down with a wave portal at the top]
 [+Boomercrazy43 True dat true dat]
 [+Boomercrazy43 Well than a rapidly-clicking insect could.]
 [just cuz they r smarter than humans doesnt mean they can rapidly tap a phone/click a mouch/tap the space bar]
 [+Boomercrazy43 Well, a dolphin could beat these "impossible" levels.]
 [how the fuck does that make a difference?]
 [+Boomercrazy43 Shut the fuck up, I didn't say they had to be possible for human beings. I said they had to be possible in general. ]
 [+Lucho MM99 I didn't say they had to be possible for human beings. I said they had to be possible in general. ]
 [see?]
 [+Danyerz http://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/7091/list-games-true-hardest-demons Look all this lvls are hacked and some of them are imposible to beat by human beings.]
 [+Boomercrazy43 Yes, they are.]
 [no they arent]
 [+Boomercrazy43 If they are beatable with hacks, or practice mode, they are possible without hacks.]
 [there are impossible levels. Silent Clubstep, Deadly silent Clubstep, Silent Circles, yeah yeah.]
 [The creator of the level has to beat it in order to release the level.]
 [he actually is the only one]
 [+Boomercrazy43 No, if you beat it, slowing it down or not, it's possible without hacks.]
 [but they hacked, so its impossible without hax]
 [+Boomercrazy43 no level is impossible if it has been verified]
 [i dont count impossibles as demons, i count them as cheap]
 [+Bilal Awan Well, it is definitely hard enough to be demon, but the person who verified it hacked..]
 [+xhunter 6 there's no logic in that]
 [+Danyerz It should be.]
 [+Bilal Awan silent clubstep isn't a demon..]
 [Riot ain't the best. Bloodbath is only the 4th hardest demon. Silent Clubstep is the hardest with the world high score of only 12% or 78%]
 [+MudkipBossitronio Ow YeAH M8 I alSO BeAT IT !!! SUp4 1zy]
 [do it.]
 [+Chompers I can give you proof that I beat bloodbath]

 [ok]
 [+Chompers He is, he uploadet a video. Hoping for more content soon!]
 [ya, hes practicing it i think]
 [There both equally good imo, Cyclic beat Sanik Wave and Riot beat BB]
 [+Outi Piirto-Maijala sorry but cyclic isnt as good as riot]
 [+xhunter 6 thank you for being logical]
 [^^^^^^^]
 [+Outi Piirto-Maijala damn you are the biggest fan boy I have ever seen -_- stop being a dip shit and be logical and understand that cyclic is not better than riot.]
 [did he beat BB?]

 [ok that im correct]

 [I'm making a level called Razor Runner, and I might need help with making the decorations around the level. The layout I will do, that's fine. But all these YT people are professionals at designing the aesthetics of a level, and I know jack-sh** about decorating levels. So I'm asking for help. I make the level, and someone with expertise maybe outfit the level however they please, based around the layout. If this gets reported, I don't care, honestly. But I want help with this. I also want to know how to collab, because the Ediotr Guide doesn't say anything about sharing levels with other creators. :c]

 [YOU DID IT. All your effort has come to one of the most hardest levels in Geometry dash history. I myself have still got a long way to go before I can reach your level. But even then. You would be even better. Then Demon Levels will get harder.]

 [Toe 2 is back on track to bloodbath]
 [+Joffski Smith i know...]
 [I didn't mean that literally retard. It is a comparison.]
 [+Joffski Smith Dude answer one question retard. Is toe 2 an auto level? Huh kid?]
 [+Joffski Smith toe 2 is level 1 compared to bloodbath]
 [Why do you have to be an idiot by comparing TOE 2 to Bloodbath? TOE 2 is auto compared to Bloodbath.]
 [Toe 2 compared to bloodbath... Bruh toe 2 is a spec compared to bloodbath]
 [+Abel Barajas FAKE CONFIRMED, you aren't providing us with evidence, you are comparing this to ToE2, saying you beat both, yeah, you are faking this. ( Except maybe the ToE2 part, that might be real. )]
 [I do not now how to screenshot]
 [+Sam Shebani proof?]
 [Theory of everything 2 is insanely easy]
 [So pretty much only riot beat it]
 [1. ToE2 is easy... And only HACKERS and RIOT have beaten Bloodbath...]
 [+Abel Barajas nope screenshot it]
 [Realllllllllllllly]
 [I actually did]
 [+Abel Barajas  yea right]
 [It was on stream retard, you can't hack on stream.]

 [;-; kill me pls]
 [+DashMania.Avi Yeah XD]
 [so true ;-;]
 [My, GOD!!!!! I cant believe that 1 comment could cause such a war!  And by the way, to be fair, I think they are both around the same. Silent Clubstep is the "Easiest" Impossible level and Bloodbath is the hardest non impossible, so i personally think that Silent Clubstep is just a bit harder than Bloodbath.]
 [Let's me get this straight. I don't care if you have more stars than me. Plus, Bloodbath is the hardest DEMON in Geometry Dash. The link Miracle gave you has unrated levels that are humanly impossible and much harder than Bloodbath. They are possible, but you would need supernatural powers to beat them. The hardest level (not demon) is Silent Engine I.]
 [You saw it?]
 [Good for you. ]
 [You can see for your self my username is gmtsean]
 [Really? How many stars and demons do you have?]
 [At least I am better than you]
 [You would need no life to ever beat that level.]
 [How do you know? Huh punk]
 [No one beat Silent Clubstep stupid, the level is nearly impossible with h4x.]
 [Plus way more people beat silent Clubstep than bloodbath]
 [That's just a stupid link asshole ]
 [+ZRSFirelordGaming Are you...THAT STUPID?!? Look at this list made by the members of Silent Engine, a group of impossible level creators. You really are uninformed... http://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/7091/official-list-hardest-maps-records]

 [@TurboSauce [GD] I hope that's a joke. Otherwise you're stupid.]

 [Silent clubstep]
 [Bloodbath by far]
 [+Hao Yu yes]

 [NoctaFly one time,but he hacking]
 [+itsAdruzGD Kappa please tell me if anyone beat bloodbath on stream!]
 [NEARLY 1M VIEWS!]
 [+The Red Wolf I know,but the top 50,000 is an example]
 [+itsAdruzGD Kappa  Riot is #9 or #7 globally.]
 [+The Red Wolf If he are in the Top #1 it doesn't mean that he's the best, taking into account that the Top 100 is based in the number of the stars that the player has. Therefore the Top #1,in this case Michigun, is the player that have who has more stars globally, that is why he is in the top #1.  Example: Some people beat Water Temple by Michigun with 2500 attempts, but nobody has beaten Bloodbath by Riot.  Riot could be in the top 50.000,by the stars,but would still be the best in the world]
 [+The Red Wolf GAMEPLAAAAAAAAAY!  (No cheating or hacking please)  No, riot is not a hacker  Gboy is a hacker to verify cataclysm not the real way, other maps of Gboy's map didn't use hacks]
 [+Cheezyman_101 No. He verified the damn level on a fucking stream, ignorant bastard.]
 [+MLG- Kaneki Oh so you're just gonna comment ignorant shit without proving your statement? Can you prove ALL top 100 are hackers? Riot, Michigun, Zobros, Vermillion, Giron, Gboy, and Insendium are in the top 100, but they are not hackers.]
 [+MLG- Kaneki Can you prove it? Hes a hacker becuase hes better than you?]
 [I could hear the delay in music so yeah "cheating"]
 [+Juan Alexandro yes, all players in top 100 are hackers]
 [+MLG- Kaneki are u sure?]
